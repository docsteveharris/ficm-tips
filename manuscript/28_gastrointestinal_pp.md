## Gastrointestinal pathology and physiology

## What are the most recent evidence based guidelines for acute pancreatitis (AP)?

These come from the [American College of Gastroenterology](http://gi.org/guideline/acute-pancreatitis/) in 2013. Severity is graded by the Atlanta revision (2013) which depends on the prescence, and duration of organ dysfunction.

**Mild**
: No organ dysfunction (Modified Marshal Score)

**Moderate**
: Transient (< 48h) organ dysfunction

**Severe** 
: Persistent (> 48h) organ dysfunction


The following points are noted:

- severe AP is defined by organ dysfunction lasting more than 48 hours
- early (within 24 hours) aggressive fluid resuscitation is recommended, but late fluids therapy should be moderated
- Abdominal ultrasound should be performed in all patients, but cross-sectional imaging should be reserved for those patient where the diagnosis is in doubt, or where the condition is not improving within the first 48-72 hours
- Routine drainage of asymptomatic necrosis or pseudocysts is _not_ recommended; where drainage is performed then, where possible, it should be deferred by 4 weeks. This permits liquification, and formation of a wall around the collection. Minimally invasive techniques for drainage are recommended over open necrosectomy.
- Routine prophylactic antibiotics are _not_ recommended; where antibiotics are used, for infected necrosis, then the drug selected should have good tissue penetration (carbapenems, quinolones, metronidazole). Ideally, a fine needle aspirate of the cyst should be performed to define the microbiology
- ERCP should be performed within 24 hours for patients with AP and cholangitis; pancreatic stents and/or NSAIDs should be used to reduce the risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis
- Enteral feeding should be started, even in severe AP. Parenteral feeding should be avoided. There is no evidence to favour nasojejunal (NJ) over nasogastric (NG) feeding.

    + compare the attenuation of the pancreas and the spleen: they should be similar. In acute pancreatitis, after 72 hours, one would expect there to be reduced contrast in the pancreas.
    + important to realise that it is impossible to determine whether the cyst contents are solid (walled off necrosis WON) or liquid (true pseudocyst). Since only the latter are amenable to drainage, then persistence of the mass after attempted drainage may warrant surgery (endoscopic as first line?)
    + use FNA do distinguish infected versus sterile collections, and to define the microbiology


## How do you defend your approach to early feeding in acute pancreatitis?

- early enteral feeding is recommended
    - maintain gut barrier, minimise bacterial translocation
    - avoid the complications of TPN
    - 2010 metanalysis demonstrated reduced mortality, infections and need for surgery
- nasojejunal tube feeding is preferred: need to place the tube beyond the ligament of Treitz 
- semi-elemental feed should be considered if assume decreased production of pancreatic enzymes (note that the elemental feeds can produce diarrhoea)
- fluid collections (cysts) are not a contra-indication but in some patients feeding may make pain or inflammation worse; if so, switch to TPN
- do not provide TPN before 5 days (increased complications)

## Summarise the issues surround Clostridium difficule infection

- 2% healthy adults are carriers but this rises to 25-50% of hospitalised patients
- contact isolation is required for the duration of the diarrhoea although there is some suggestion that skin carriage may persist thereafter and isolation should continue until discharge.
- spores persist months, and are best killed with hypochlorite not bleach
- increased risk of infection for subsequent occupier of room where prev c diff (hence raised the question of using same room for immunocompromised)
- diagnosis requires
    + moderate to severe diarrhoea (≥3 loose stools/day for ≥2 day) __or__ ileus; if diarrhoea is severe, nocturnal, or accompanied by a fever then consider testing on the first day
    + stool containing C diff toxin, or positive for C fiff on culture
- C diff toxin degrades within 2 hours at room temperature so refridgerate specimens that might be delayed
- C diff toxins may be detected by
    + PCR (rapid, sensitive, specific)
    + Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) Laboratory diagnosis for bacterial glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) but this does not distinguish toxigenic from non-virulent strains
    + EIA for C. difficile toxins A and B (high false negative rate)
    + Cell culture cytotoxicity assay (gold standard)
    + Selective anaerobic culture (slow, labour intensive)
- stool assays remain positive during treatment, and after recovery

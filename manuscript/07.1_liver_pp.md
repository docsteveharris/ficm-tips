# Liver physiology and pathology

## Miscellaneous pearls

- Considering immunosuppression in acute liver failure, or in the context of transplant? Check HBV surface antigen else without nimivudine prophylaxis then there is a risk of HBV reactivation
- hypoxic liver injury typically means that ALT is raised out of proportion to AST
- What is the Pringle manouevre? Clamp the hepatic ligament for haemostasis during surgery, or for an uncontrolled bleed. The hepatic ligament carries the portal vein, hepatic artery, and bike duct. Clamp for 10mins max then 5 mins off, and repeat if needed
- What does small for size (post-hepatic resection) mean? There is too much portal flow for the liver to cope with reactive hepatic artery constriction to compensate. This leads to cholestasis and ischaemia, and is worsened by concomitant sepsis. It is more common in males, elderly, and diabetics.

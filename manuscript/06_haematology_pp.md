# Haematology physiology and pathology

## Quickly summarise multiple myeloma for a medical student

### Clinical

1. consequences of plasma cell proliferation: anaemia (normochromic, normocytic); neutropaenia; thrombocytopaenia; skeletal lytic lesions (60% patients), hypercalcaemia (25% patients), soft tissue infiltration by plasma cells
2. consequences of M-protein production: renal failure (50% patients at some stage; Bence-Jones protein (80% pts) particularly toxic b/c enters tubule then causes obstruction); hyperviscosity (ocular probs, CVA, DVT & PE, increases plasma volume hence potential cardiac failure)
3. consequences of immunodeficiency (low concentration of normal immunoglobulins)

## List the parameters reported by a thromboelastogram (TEG)

- R value = reaction time (s); time of latency from start of test to initial fibrin formation (amplitude of 2mm); i.e. initiation
- K = kinetics (s); time taken to achieve a certain level of clot strength (amplitude of 20mm); i.e. amplification
alpha = angle (slope between R and K); measures the speed at which fibrin build up and cross linking takes place, hence assesses the rate of clot formation; i.e. thrombin burst
- TMA = time to maximum amplitude(s)
- MA = maximum amplitude (mm); represents the ultimate strength of the fibrin clot; i.e. overall stability of the clot
- A30 or LY30 = amplitude at 30 minutes; percentage decrease in amplitude at 30 minutes post-MA and gives measure of degree of fibrinolysis
- CLT = clot lysis time (s)

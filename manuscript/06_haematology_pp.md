# Haematology physiology and pathology

## Quickly summarise multiple myeloma for a medical student

### Clinical

1. consequences of plasma cell proliferation: anaemia (normochromic, normocytic); neutropaenia; thrombocytopaenia; skeletal lytic lesions (60% patients), hypercalcaemia (25% patients), soft tissue infiltration by plasma cells
2. consequences of M-protein production: renal failure (50% patients at some stage; Bence-Jones protein (80% pts) particularly toxic b/c enters tubule then causes obstruction); hyperviscosity (ocular probs, CVA, DVT & PE, increases plasma volume hence potential cardiac failure)
3. consequences of immunodeficiency (low concentration of normal immunoglobulins)

# Haematology physiology and pathology

## What is the ideal haemoglobin level?

What is the minimum Hb necessary? 

- Heart does not become ischaemia/anaerobic until Hb<3.5 assuming normal coronaries and perfusion pressures/work (i.e. can bleed fit and healthy down to Hb 3.5.  
- But there are negative effects at low Hb: i.e. Patients with CCF "clinically" better with Hb>10; Hip fracture patients walk further with higher Hb; Elite athletes (aerobic) perform better with higher Hct.  DO2 is clearly rate limiting in certain situations, and a higher Hb is desirable if not essential.
- Methods to raise/preserve Hb: 
    - ICU (Webb blood sampling, haemolysis, haemorrhage etc: average loss per admission 2-3 units); TNFÎ± switches off bone marrow; 
    - [EPO ineffective in critical illness](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24273484)

### Clinical

1. consequences of plasma cell proliferation: anaemia (normochromic, normocytic); neutropaenia; thrombocytopaenia; skeletal lytic lesions (60% patients), hypercalcaemia (25% patients), soft tissue infiltration by plasma cells
2. consequences of M-protein production: renal failure (50% patients at some stage; Bence-Jones protein (80% pts) particularly toxic b/c enters tubule then causes obstruction); hyperviscosity (ocular probs, CVA, DVT & PE, increases plasma volume hence potential cardiac failure)
3. consequences of immunodeficiency (low concentration of normal immunoglobulins)

## List the parameters reported by a thromboelastogram (TEG)

- R value = reaction time (s); time of latency from start of test to initial fibrin formation (amplitude of 2mm); i.e. initiation
- K = kinetics (s); time taken to achieve a certain level of clot strength (amplitude of 20mm); i.e. amplification
alpha = angle (slope between R and K); measures the speed at which fibrin build up and cross linking takes place, hence assesses the rate of clot formation; i.e. thrombin burst
- TMA = time to maximum amplitude(s)
- MA = maximum amplitude (mm); represents the ultimate strength of the fibrin clot; i.e. overall stability of the clot
- A30 or LY30 = amplitude at 30 minutes; percentage decrease in amplitude at 30 minutes post-MA and gives measure of degree of fibrinolysis
- CLT = clot lysis time (s)

## When should you consider a diagnosis of HIT?

- [Cuker AA, Gimotty PAPA, Crowther MAMA et al. Predictive value of the 4Ts scoring system for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis. *Blood*. 2012;**120**:4160-4167.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood-2012-07-443051)
    - To examine the accuracy of the 4Ts score in predicting HIT, academic investigators performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 trials comprising 3068 patients with suspected HIT evaluated by the 4Ts scoring system and a reference standard.
    - The negative predictive value of a low probability 4Ts score was 0.998.
    - The probability of HIT is low
        - low (1--3 points): 55% patients, NPV 0.998
        - medium (4--5 points): 36% patients, PPV 14%
        - high (6--8 points): 8% patients, PPV 64%

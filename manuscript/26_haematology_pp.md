# Haematology physiology and pathology

## What is the ideal haemoglobin level?

What is the minimum Hb necessary?

- Heart does not become ischaemia/anaerobic until Hb<3.5 assuming normal coronaries and perfusion pressures/work (i.e. can bleed fit and healthy down to Hb 3.5.
- But there are negative effects at low Hb: i.e. Patients with CCF "clinically" better with Hb>10; Hip fracture patients walk further with higher Hb; Elite athletes (aerobic) perform better with higher Hct.  DO2 is clearly rate limiting in certain situations, and a higher Hb is desirable if not essential.
- Methods to raise/preserve Hb:
    - ICU (Webb blood sampling, haemolysis, haemorrhage etc: average loss per admission 2-3 units); TNFα switches off bone marrow;
    - [EPO ineffective in critical illness](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24273484)

### Clinical

1. consequences of plasma cell proliferation: anaemia (normochromic, normocytic); neutropaenia; thrombocytopaenia; skeletal lytic lesions (60% patients), hypercalcaemia (25% patients), soft tissue infiltration by plasma cells
2. consequences of M-protein production: renal failure (50% patients at some stage; Bence-Jones protein (80% pts) particularly toxic b/c enters tubule then causes obstruction); hyperviscosity (ocular probs, CVA, DVT & PE, increases plasma volume hence potential cardiac failure)
3. consequences of immunodeficiency (low concentration of normal immunoglobulins)

## List the parameters reported by a thromboelastogram (TEG)

- R value = reaction time (s); time of latency from start of test to initial fibrin formation (amplitude of 2mm); i.e. initiation
- K = kinetics (s); time taken to achieve a certain level of clot strength (amplitude of 20mm); i.e. amplification
alpha = angle (slope between R and K); measures the speed at which fibrin build up and cross linking takes place, hence assesses the rate of clot formation; i.e. thrombin burst
- TMA = time to maximum amplitude(s)
- MA = maximum amplitude (mm); represents the ultimate strength of the fibrin clot; i.e. overall stability of the clot
- A30 or LY30 = amplitude at 30 minutes; percentage decrease in amplitude at 30 minutes post-MA and gives measure of degree of fibrinolysis
- CLT = clot lysis time (s)

## When should you consider a diagnosis of HIT?

- [Cuker AA, Gimotty PAPA, Crowther MAMA et al. Predictive value of the 4Ts scoring system for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis. *Blood*. 2012;**120**:4160-4167.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood-2012-07-443051)
    - To examine the accuracy of the 4Ts score in predicting HIT, academic investigators performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 trials comprising 3068 patients with suspected HIT evaluated by the 4Ts scoring system and a reference standard.
    - The negative predictive value of a low probability 4Ts score was 0.998.
    - The probability of HIT is low
        - low (1--3 points): 55% patients, NPV 0.998
        - medium (4--5 points): 36% patients, PPV 14%
        - high (6--8 points): 8% patients, PPV 64%

## What is the most useful investigation for evaluating thrombocytopaenia?

> A peripheral-blood smear is a vital investigation tool in most cases to confirm a low platelet count and the presence or absence of other diagnostic features, such as red-cell fragmentation, platelet morphologic abnormalities, or evidence of dysplasia or hematinic deficiency.

## Factor V Leiden

*   Single nucleotide mutation means that FV is resistant to proteolysis by activated Protein C
*   Remember that FV is the platelet surface bound catalyst with 2 arms that holds FXa to FII (Prothrombin) to allow it to be converted to Thrombin
*   5% prevalence in Caucasian, 10% Scandanavia, and 0.1% in Asia
*   Consumptive coagulopathy common with certain neoplasms (i.e. AML (M5), Prostate, Ovarian)

## ACT (Activated Clotting Time)

In the Haemochron activated clotting time (HACT), 2 ml of whole blood is added to a black-topped test tube containing celite and a ferro-magnetic bar and a timer is started. The tube is warmed to 37oC and gently rotated within the test well. As coagulation occurs, the bar rotates with the tube and is detected by a magnetic sensor.
The normal (baseline) value is 120–140 s and the accepted variability of the test is 10%.
The test is widely used in situations where assessment of systemic heparinization is required almost instantaneously for example cardiac surgery, cardiac catheterisation, haemofiltration.

## Summarise briefly your understanding of haemostasis/clotting

1. Platelet activation
    - via collagen: normally functionally hidden by endothelium
    - via thrombin through protease-activated receptors (PAR-1, PAR-4)
    - via ADP binding to P2Y1 and P2Y12 receptors
2. Platelet adhesion
    - von Willebrand factor (vWF) in the subendothelial matrix binds to platelet GPIb/IX/V complexes
3. Platelet aggregation
    - via GPIIb/IIIa surface receptors that bind and cross link vWF and fibrinogen
4. Platelet secretion
    - activated and bound platelets now release granules containing ADP, serotonin etc that lead to further platelet activation
5. Procoagulant activity


Final commmon pathway for clotting cascade

- thrombin (II) converts fibrinogen (I) to fibrin
- Factor X converts prothrombin to thrombin
- multiple different 'tenases' activate FX

### Other notes

> All of the procoagulants are synthesized in the liver except von Willebrand factor (VWF), which is synthesized in megakaryocytes and endothelial cells, and factor VIII, which is produced by endothelial cells.

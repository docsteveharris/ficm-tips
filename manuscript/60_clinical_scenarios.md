# Clinical scenarios

## Should I cool a patient after cardiac arrest?

Currently this is controversial with conflicting evidence in the literature. However, there seems to be a consensus that _hyperthermia_ (T>36C)is harmful, and should be actively prevented.

Trials of therapeutic hypothermia (TH)

- [2002 NEJM](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=11856793): 275 patients after VF cardiac arrest showed better neurological outcomes and survival at 6 months. Very roughly the control arm had a 50% 6 month mortality and 50% poor neurological outcomes. Patients in the TH (32-34C) arm had roughly a 25% RR reduction in these outcomes
- [TTM trial, 2013 NEJM](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=24237006): 939 patients after cardiac arrest had a similar range of outcomes in the control arm, and _no_ difference in outcomes with the TH (32-34C)

Both trials achieved their temperature targets within 6--8 hours.

### Other notes

- metabolism decreases 7-10% per degree C cooled below 37C, but shivering will increase metabolism by 40-100%
- Arrhythmia risk (VF/VT) increases below 28-30C
- myocardial contractility often increases!
- insulin resistance is common

## How to diagnose brain stem death?


### Preconditions

1. Apneoic patient on ventilator
2. Structural cause of brain injury (trauma or haemorrhage)
3. Reversible causes excluded: endocrine, metabolic and drugs (Na<160, T>34

### Testing

- Who? Not part of transplant team, 1 consultant and one doctor >5yr registered
- When? >6hrs after coma onset or 24hrs post ROSC if cardiac arrest causal
- Two tests needed but time inbetween not specified

- How?

    1. CN2 & 3: Pupillary reflexes
    2. CNVa and VII: No corneal reflex
    3. CNVII: No  motor response in cranial nerve region (i.e. facial) to peripheral or central pain; Spinal reflex movements allowed
    4. CNIII,IV, & VI & CNVIII: Oculo-vestibular: 50ml ice cold water, observe for 1 minute after
    5. CNIX & X: Suction catheter to pharynx and trachea
    6. Respiratory Centres: 5min 100% preox; 10min apnoea to PaCO2>6.7; Maintain O2 via suction catheter in ETT with >250ml/min O2 (new guidelines will say pH<7.35 too)

Time of death is documented as first test


### Notes

- DCD (donation after cardiac death) Non-Heart Beating Donor Guidance (kidneys, lungs, livers, corneas);
    - warm ischaemia time is problematic: types of donor 'awaiting cardiac arrest' commonest (ie icu patients where treatment is being withdrawn but who don't make brainstem death criteria);
    - 5mins after arrest confirm death - if death is not rapid then organ donation wil not be possible
Contraindications to organ donation
- HIV, nvCJD
- Malignancy except primary brain tumours
- Patient refusal

# Respiratory physiology and pathology

## What changed in the 2012 Berlin definition of ARDS?

The new Berlin definition replaced the 1994 American-European Consensus Conference definition. The following is a distilled summary:

- exclude alternatives: cardiogenic and other causes of respiratory failure must have been excluded. Objective evidence of preserved cardiac function is required if there are no risk factors for ARDS.
- demonstrate an acute course: new or worsened disease within a week
- Bilateral radiographic changes: not otherwise explained
- a low PF ratio with CPAP or PEEP {$$}\geq5cmH_{2}O{/$$}
    + Mild: PF ratio 200-300mmHg (27--40kPa)
    + Moderate: PF ratio 100-200 mmHg (13-27kPa)
    + Severe: PF ratio â‰¤100mmHg (13kPa)
- Pulse oximetry can be used instead of arterial blood gas analysis via S:F ratios:
    + 200mmHg (27kPa) = 235
    + 300mmHg (40kPa) = 315

The main differences were from the 1994 definition were

- the inclusion of PEEP
- abandoning ALI (Acute Lung Injury) as a label

## Should I use inhaled nitric oxide in severe respiratory failure?

Two meta-analyses attempted to answer this question, and found that while NO improves oxygenation, there is no improvement in outcome. This mirrors the concept that it is not the severity of ARDS (as measured by PF rations) that determines outcome.

As usual, despite the lack of an average population benefit, the question of individual benefit remains unresolved. You might consider the use of inhaled NO in

- patients with high pulmonary vascular resistance
- in 'responders': this means trying NO and

Also note

- there is evidence of increased renal failure
- there is stronger evidence in children
- tachyphylaxis occurs
- [consider as rescue therapy for acute right ventricular failure following PE](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16598645)
- inhaled prostacyclin as an alternative that is much easier to administer

## When to initiate glucocorticoids in ARDS?

T> ### Rule of thumb
T>
T> Do _not_ start steroids _after_ the first 2 weeks of ARDS.


The literature is not clear. The ARDS network trial suggested benefit if started during the second week, and harm if started later. The 'Meduri' trial suggested benefit when started within 72 hours of the onset of disease.

Typical treatment regimes are 1mg/kg of methylprednisolone per day for at least 7 days.

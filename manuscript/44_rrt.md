## Q: What is the best dose of Renal Replacement Therapy?

- anticipate that around 85% of the prescribed dose is delivered
- conflicting evidence for improved survival in sepsis except in ATN trial where the opposite was observed
- trend to increased ESRF with higher doses of CVVH

    - the original RCT that compared outcomes with different RRT doses
    - RCT, 425 patients in ICU with ARF, 15 day survival
        - sepsis in ~15%
    - 3 doses 20,35, and 45 mls/kg/hr
        - dose based on actual body weight (from existing health records)
        - CVVH (no dialysis)
        - lactate based fluid
    - 20 mls/kg/hr had worst survival
    - 45 mls/kg/hr had worst recovert of renal function (90% vs 95%)

    - RCT, 1508 patients in ICU with standard indication for RRT (oliguria, acidosis, hyperkalaemia, creat > 300, oedema etc)
        - severe sepsis in 50%
    - CVVHDF with dialysate to filtrate ratio of 1:1 and all post-filter
    - 25 vs 40 mls/kg/hr doses targeted and 22 and 33 achieved
        - actual body weight at time of randomisation
        - bicarbonate based fluid
    - no difference in survival among all comes (45% mortality at 90 days)
    - similar trend to increase ESRF among those on higher dose (6.8% vs 4.4%): 'if you don't use it, you lose it' signal?
    - trend to reduced mortality in patients with sepsis (46.8 vs 51.2%)
    - late start: 6 days in ICU at enrollment

    - wider inclusion criteria than Cochrane review (Borthwick)

    - post-operative (50% cardiac) ventilated patients with oliguria and CrCl < 30ml/min
    - dose varied from 20 to 48 mls/kg/hr
    - early grp started  within 7 hours, late grp within 42 hrs
    - no difference in outcomes

- [Storck M, Hartl WH, Zimmerer E et al. Comparison of pump-driven and spontaneous continuous haemofiltration in postoperative acute renal failure. *Lancet*. 1991;**337**:452-455
    - a very early study which had the side effect of examining very low dose RRT
    - CAVH (arterial) vs CVVH (pump driven)
    - better survival with higher doses over range 7--15 l/day which is equivalent to 4--8 mls/kg/hr

    - RCT, 1124 patients with MOF or sepsis
    - high dose = IHD if stable else SLED 6x/week or CVVHDF at 35 mls/kg/hr
    - low dose = IHD if stable else SLED 3x/week or CVVHDF at 20 mls/kg/hr
    - stable meant SOFA CVS 0--2 and unstable meant SOFA CVS 3--4
    - 50% septic
    - actual body weight used (before illness)
    - outcomes similar
        - but low dose better for sepsis this time
        - possible trend to incr ESRF among the high dose again
    - late randomisation again (1 week in ICU)

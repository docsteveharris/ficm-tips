# Neuro-critical care physiology and pathology

## Describe the waveform seen on an ICP monitor

- The waveform should look like normal arterial trace with additional upstroke (P2) between systolic peak (P1) and dicrotic notch (P3); this is the reflected pressure wave from the non compliant skull and should be lower than P1
- When ICP is high then P2>P1

## Drug tips

### Naloxone

- Onset of action: Endotracheal, I.M., SubQ: 2-5 minutes; Inhalation via nebulization: ~5 minutes (Mycyk, 2003); Intranasal: ~8-13 minutes (Kelley, 2005; Robertson, 2009); I.V.: ~2 minutes
- Duration: ~30-120 minutes depending on route of administration; I.V. has a shorter duration of action than I.M. administration; since naloxone's action is shorter than that of most opioids, repeated doses are usually needed
- Metabolism: Primarily hepatic via glucuronidation
- Half-life elimination: Neonates: 3-4 hours; Adults: 0.5-1.5 hours

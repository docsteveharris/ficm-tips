# Infection

## Antibiotic pearls

- linezolid has much better outcomes for staphylococcal pneumonia

## How common is fungal infection in critical care?

- 19% of patients with infection in critical care using point prevalence data in the [EPIC II study](Vincent J, Rello J, Marshall J, et al. International Study of the Prevalence and Outcomes of Infection in Intensive Care Units. JAMA. 2009;302(21):2323-2329. doi:10.1001/jama.2009.1754.) but very clear problems with methodology ascertainment bias

## Discuss the microbiology of community acquired pneumonia?

- many culture negative cases are caused by pneumococcus?
    - sputum cultures -ve in 50% patients with pneumococcal bacteraemia
    - 50% of culture negative cases respond to penicillin
    - using more invasive diagnostic techniques yields higher rates of strep pneumoniae

## Getting a pneumonia diagnosis

- purulent sputum in an intubated patient may still just indicate tracheobronchitis
- fastidious organisms may not survive prolonged transport

- Expectorated sputum (but often is an upper not lower respiratory tract specimen); but recommended for all critically ill patients (but often not for outpatient managed cases)
    - reject samples > squamous epithelial cells (SEC) per low power field (LPC)
    - sample should ideally contain polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN)
    - proceed to gram stain
    - tips
        - sample before antibiotics
        - rinse mouth first
- Bronchoscopy washings, variable utility,
    - Mini-BAL: advance catheter until obstruction met, flush saline, suction
    - Bronchoscopic washings may provide better samples, and lead to more rapid de-escalation of broad spectrum antibiotics
    - can do a cell count ?exclude pneumonia if neutrophils <50% of total nucleated cells

## What are the principles of infection control in critical care?


Critical care units run at near full occupancy, and so allocation of patients to the unit is difficult.  Full units cause delays to admission which, in turn, may lead to worse outcomes.  Not all bed spaces in a unit are suitable for all patients. Some require patients require isolation either because they might infect others, or because they are vulnerable to infections themselves. The number of rooms in an ICU suitable for isolation is even more limited, and it allocating a patient to a side room means cross-cover by nursing staff of more than one patient is often impractical. This further decreases the ability of the critical care team to respond flexibly to increased demand.

For these reasons, it is necessary to have a very clear understanding of the evidence for infection control. Inappropriately nursing an infective patient in an open ward is a risk to others. Inappropriately isolating a patient increases bed pressure.

This discussion will focus just on patients with infections that present a risk to others.

### Pathogens and method of contagion

Pathogens may be simply divided into four categories:

1. Those that do not represent an infection risk to others (other than through direct inoculation) e.g. Hepatitis B

2. Those where infection may be spread by direct contact

    - Colonization of any bodily site with multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA, VRE)
    - Enteric infections (C. difficile, E. coli O157:H7, viral infections (RSV, HSV, enterovirus, parainfluenza))
    - Scabies
    - Impetigo
    - Noncontained abcesses or decubitus ulcers (especially for Staphylococcus aureus and group A streptococcus)

    Contact precautions are necessary and the patients need to be isolated or lodged with others with the same infection. Health care workers entering the area need contact precautions (gown, gloves, hand-washing) whether in contact with the patient or just with material and equipment in the room.

3. Those where airborne droplet contagion is possible

    - Neisseria meningitidis
    - Haemophilus influenzae type B
    - Mycoplasma pneumoniae
    - Bordetella pertussis
    - Diphtheria
    - Pneumonic plague
    - Influenza
    - Rubella
    - Mumps
    - Adenovirus
    - Parvovirus B19
    - RSV

    Droplets are suspended airborne particles greater than 5 microns in diameter that will not usually travel more than 1 meter though 2 meters is thought possible. HCWs should wear masks within this radius, and probably up to 3 meters. The doors of the room do not to need to be closed, and for respiratory viruses that can be transmitted by contact then precautions as above should also be followed.

    Those involved with respiratory procedures that generate aerosols (induction of anaesthesia, bronchoscopy, bronchial toilet etc.) should wear a respirator, and because of droplet during the procedure then the environment will need cleaning thereafter. If possible, such procedures should be performed in Airborne Infection Isolation Rooms (AIRR) rooms.

4. Those where airborne contagion is possible

    - Tuberculosis
    - Varicella
    - Measles
    - Smallpox
    - SARS

    Airborne spread is possible when the infective particle is smaller than 5 microns as these remain suspended in the air. These patients need to be housed in a negative pressure room with 6--12 air changes per hour, and HCWs should wear a certified respirator (HEPA (high-efficiency particulate aerator) filter) that potentially blocks more than 99% of viral particles. Although the evidence for the superiority over standard face masks is not clear[@Loeb:2009kd], there appears to be a subset of patients who are 'super-emitters' of RNA viral particles that will pass through standard surgical masks, and spread more than 3 meters.[@Bischoff:2013ch]
    Doors to the room must be closed.

    Pathogen lists from a Table in General Principles of Infection Control in UpToDate "General Principles of Infection Control"[@Friedman:2013tx]

The criteria for discontinuing isolation of patients is a key determinant of the strain on ICU beds, and patient safety. For droplet contagion, the advice is that isolation should continue for a minimum of 7 days, and until fever and respiratory symptoms resolve. No ICU patient is likely to be free of respiratory symptoms so practically this means until discharge from the unit. For patients who are also immunocompromised then viral shedding is likely to be prolonged.

### Notes

Duration of isolation:
- this is a key determinant of unit occupancy: to discuss
- noravirus and Sapporovirus contact isolation but some limited evidence of airborne droplet and v low inoculum required for infection (18 viruses in context of 10e10 shed per g stool). Most individuals clear virus within 2-3 days but immunocompromised may be longer

- VRE: 3 negative stool cultures each 1 week apart but as with C difficle some concern about recolonisation and some conflicting recommendations suggest no point in culturing previous infected patients within a year as they tend to remain positive; active surveillance as for mrsa beneficial

- side rooms - benefits thereof

Prophylactic approaches that work

* daily chlorhexidine bathing
* bio patches
* routine rotation of catheters
* deep cleaning

## What measures are effective in controlling the spread of MRSA?

- MRSA
- depends on efficacy of decolonisation and who is contaminated
    - HCW
    - Patient:
        - Define purpose: to reduce risk of infection then prob effective (see data on daily chlorhexidine baths etc) but for infection control then efficacy harder to demonstrate
        - Not consistently effective: Loeb MB, Main C, Eady A, Walker-Dilks C. Antimicrobial drugs for treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization. Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2003; :CD003340.
        - Not durable so 50% recolonised within 6 months - this includes HCWs: hence why re-screening prev infection is important and should assume prev infection is risk factor for new
        - routine screening post decolonisation not recommended? so assume decolonisation effective
    -  topical mupopiricin to nares but 25% resistance in US already and chlorhexidine baths

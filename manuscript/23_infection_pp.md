# Infection

## Antibiotic pearls

- linezolid has much better outcomes for staphylococcal pneumonia

## Discuss the microbiology of community acquired pneumonia?

- many culture negative cases are caused by pneumococcus?
    - sputum cultures -ve in 50% patients with pneumococcal bacteraemia
    - 50% of culture negative cases respond to penicillin
    - using more invasive diagnostic techniques yields higher rates of strep pneumoniae

## Getting a pneumonia diagnosis

- purulent sputum in an intubated patient may still just indicate tracheobronchitis
- fastidious organisms may not survive prolonged transport

- Expectorated sputum (but often is an upper not lower respiratory tract specimen); but recommended for all critically ill patients (but often not for outpatient managed cases)
    - reject samples > squamous epithelial cells (SEC) per low power field (LPC)
    - sample should ideally contain polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN)
    - proceed to gram stain
    - tips
        - sample before antibiotics
        - rinse mouth first
- Bronchoscopy washings, variable utility,
    - Mini-BAL: advance catheter until obstruction met, flush saline, suction
    - Bronchoscopic washings may provide better samples, and lead to more rapid de-escalation of broad spectrum antibiotics
    - can do a cell count ?exclude pneumonia if neutrophils <50% of total nucleated cells

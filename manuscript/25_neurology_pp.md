# Neuro-critical care physiology and pathology

## Describe the waveform seen on an ICP monitor

- The waveform should look like normal arterial trace with additional upstroke (P2) between systolic peak (P1) and dicrotic notch (P3); this is the reflected pressure wave from the non compliant skull and should be lower than P1
- When ICP is high then P2>P1

## What do I need to know about a lumbar drain?

- Zero is set at the height of the insertion point
- Set pressure to 10-20cm H2O
- Maximum drainage rate is 20-30 ml/hr  which matches CSF production 
- Should be removed within 48 hours
- Indicated for supra renal aortic aneurysm repair 

## Can you recommend any good references for learning about the EEG in neuro-critical care?

Try this article in [Neurotherapies](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3271154/)

Important points from the article include

- around 1/4 patients in critical care demonstrated siezure activity _after_ the first 24 hours of monitoring suggesting that prolonged, not snapshot, monitors should be considered
- siezures are common after intra-cerebral and sub-arachnoid haemorrhage with rates between 10% and 30% quoted

# Guidelines for the management of intra-cerebral haemorrhage

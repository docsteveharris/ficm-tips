# Neuro-critical care physiology and pathology

## Sub-arachnoid haemorrhage

A list of evidence based guidance

- Unexplained sudden increases in ICP may be related to siezures via flow-metabolism coupling hence the logic of increasing sedation
- [Routine prophylactic anti-convulsants may be harmful](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17695377)

## Describe the waveform seen on an ICP monitor

- The waveform should look like normal arterial trace with additional upstroke (P2) between systolic peak (P1) and dicrotic notch (P3); this is the reflected pressure wave from the non compliant skull and should be lower than P1
- When ICP is high then P2>P1

## What do I need to know about a lumbar drain?

- Zero is set at the height of the insertion point
- Set pressure to 10-20cm H2O
- Maximum drainage rate is 20-30 ml/hr  which matches CSF production
- Should be removed within 48 hours
- Indicated for supra renal aortic aneurysm repair

## Can you recommend any good references for learning about the EEG in neuro-critical care?

Try this article in [Neurotherapies](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3271154/), and consider downloading [EEG for dummies](https://wiki.umms.med.umich.edu/download/attachments/90736111/EEG+for+dummies.docx?version=1&modificationDate=1400772772000)

Important points from the article include

- around 1/4 patients in critical care demonstrated siezure activity _after_ the first 24 hours of monitoring suggesting that prolonged, not snapshot, monitors should be considered
- siezures are common after intra-cerebral, sub-arachnoid haemorrhage, and hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy with rates between 10% and 30% quoted; rates are lower (5%) following cerebral infarcts. Regardless of the aetiology, the greater the severity, the greater the chance of siezures
- around 1 in 3 patients develop non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) after the termination of the convulsive form

## Guidelines for the management of intra-cerebral haemorrhage

See [Guidelines for the management of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20651276)


## Summarise the history surrounding the understanding of ICU acquired weakness

- 1977 - myopathy described following steroids and neuromuscular blockers for patient with asthma
- Bolton desceribed polyneuropathy in patients in ICU; primarily axonal and motor, no demyelination, decrease in anterior horn cells and reduction in amplitute of compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs)

Characteristics
- proximal > distal
- CK normal
- spares face and ocular muscles
- may involve respiratory muscles

Distinguish critical illness myopathy and critical illness polyneuropathy on the basis of sensory nerve involvement (reduced sensory nerve action potential - SNAP)

Pathophysiology
- microvascular disturbance and neuronal damage
- hyperglycaemia
- channelopathies (sodium)
- muscle catabolism
- mitochondrial damage

Risk factors
- severity of illness
- steroids ?but some evidence of protection too!?
- neuromuscular blocking drugs (NMB) in patients with asthma (although note improved survival in ARDS)
- immobility
- females >> males

## How do I manage anti-platelet therapy for a coronary stent?

Because of their dependence on anti-platelet therapy, coronary stents can be very difficult to manage in the critically ill patient.

There are three types (currently):

- Bare metal stents: a shorter period of 4-6 weeks dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT) but with a  higher 1 yr restenosis rate
- Drug eluting stents: a longer (minimum 1 year) period of DAT but with a lower 1 year restenosis. There is however then a higher late stenosis from failure of epithelialisation.
- Biocompatible stends: DAT period maybe as short as 1 week? Assume that these are expensive!

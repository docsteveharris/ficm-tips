## What changed in the 2012 Berlin definition of ARDS?

The new Berlin definition replaced the 1994 American-European Consensus Conference definition. The following is a distilled summary:

- exclude alternatives: cardiogenic and other causes of respiratory failure must have been excluded. Objective evidence of preserved cardiac function is required if there are no risk factors for ARDS.
- demonstrate an acute course: new or worsened disease within a week
- Bilateral radiographic changes: not otherwise explained
- a low PF ratio with CPAP or PEEP {$$}\geq5cmH_{2}O{$$}
    + Mild: PF ratio 200-300mmHg (27--40kPa)
    + Moderate: PF ratio 100-200 mmHg (13-27kPa)
    + Severe: PF ratio â‰¤100mmHg (13kPa)
- Pulse oximetry can be used instead of arterial blood gas analysis via S:F ratios:
    + 200mmHg (27kPa) = 235
    + 300mmHg (40kPa) = 315

# Cardiovascular support

## What is the ideal blood pressure target?

### Evidence

- [Asfar P, Meziani F, Hamel JF et al. High versus low blood-pressure target in patients with septic shock. *N Engl J Med*. 2014;**370**:1583-1593.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1312173)
    - RCT of 776 patients with septic shock with either a target MAP of  65-70mmHg (low) or 80-85mmHg (high); good separation of blood pressure for the 5 protocol days by 10mmHg
        + more noradrenaline (additional 0.1-0.2mcg/kg/min) used for longer in the treatment arm
    - patients had to have an initial vasopressor dose of 0.1mcg/kg/min
    - high target patients had more atrial fibrillation presumably related to the greater dose of inotropes; there was also less use of RRT but without any mortality benefit
        + RRT criteria were biochemical not volume related 
        + Doubling of creatinine similar in both arms

- [Jansen TC, Van Bommel J, Schoonderbeek J et al. Early Lactate-Guided Therapy in ICU Patients: A Multicenter, Open-Label, Randomized, Controlled Trial. *Am J Respir Crit Care Med*. 201010.1164/rccm.200912-1918OC)
    - RCT using lactate as a target for 8 hours on admission ton ICU in a mixed population showed benefit
    - initial lactate known in both arms but repeat measurements not available in the control arm
    - there was _no_ greater improvement in lactate in the intervention arm than in the control arm (i.e. no feedback, and it seems likely that lactate just motivated the clinicians to be more 'aggressive')
    - lactate arm received more fluids and vasodilators (GTN) but similar doses of vasopressors and blood
    - effect modification apparent based on early vs late ICU admission (defined as ICU admission within 6 hours of hospital admission)


## Which is the ideal vasopressor in septic shock?


- dopamine is harmful partly because it increases the incidence of arrhythmia
- noradrenaline is the most commonly used agent, but there is no evidence to demonstrate its superiority over other drugs (or vice versa)
- adrenaline is equivalent to noradrenaline but the (transient) metabolic effects are 'ugly'
- vasopressin remains a 'rescue' therapy when noradrenaline fails

## Experimental therapies in shock

- Non-selective Nitric Oxide inhibition does not work[Alexander JH, Reynolds HR, Stebbins AL et al. Effect of tilarginine acetate in patients with acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock: the TRIUMPH randomized controlled trial. *JAMA*. 2007;**297**:1657-1666.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.297.15.joc70035)
    + RCT terminated on safety grounds because greater with trends to higher cardiovascular mortality in the intervention arm, but also more speedy resolution of shock




## Balloon pumps

IABP efficiency is determined by:

- Timing of balloon inflation and deflation
- Assist ratio (e.g. 1:1 – balloon inflation and deflation on every cardiac cycle – provides greater circulatory assistance than 1:2 or 1:4 – balloon inflation and deflation on every 2nd or 4th cardiac cycle )
- Heart rate (efficiency is greatly decreased at heart rates >130/min)
- Gas loss from balloon (balloon volume)
- Minimum cardiac index of 1.2 – 1.4 L/min/m2 is required for IABP assistance to be clinically beneficial


IABP should be adjusted so that the following criteria are met

- inflation of the balloon occurs at the dicrotic notch (forming the sharp ‘V’)
- the slope of rise of augmented diastolic waveform is straight and parallel to the systolic upstroke
- the augmented DBP at balloon deflation exceeds or is equal to end-systolic BP
- the end-diastolic BP at balloon deflation is lower than the preceding unassisted end-DBP by 15-20 mmHg
- the assisted SBP (following a cycle of balloon inflation) is lower than the previous unassisted SBP by 5 mmHg


However, there is no evidence for clinical benefit with IABP, nor, interestingly, of harm.

# Neuro-critical care physiology and pathology

## Which patients need ICP monitors?

- GCS<8 _and_ an abnormal CT but especially if 
    - young (age<40)
    - motor posturing
    - hypotensive

ICP monitoring RCT Chesnut NEJM 2012: 324 patients, 5 South American hospitals, no harm demonstrated even though no experience with ICP monitors

## Describe the waveform seen on an ICP monitor

- The waveform should look like normal arterial trace with additional upstroke (P2) between systolic peak (P1) and dicrotic notch (P3); this is the reflected pressure wave from the non compliant skull and should be lower than P1
- When ICP is high then P2>P1

## What do I need to know about a lumbar drain?

- Zero is set at the height of the insertion point
- Set pressure to 10-20cm H2O
- Maximum drainage rate is 20-30 ml/hr  which matches CSF production 
- Should be removed within 48 hours
- Indicated for supra renal aortic aneurysm repair

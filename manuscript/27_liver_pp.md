# Liver physiology and pathology

## Miscellaneous pearls

- Considering immunosuppression in acute liver failure, or in the context of transplant? Check HBV surface antigen else without nimivudine prophylaxis then there is a risk of HBV reactivation
- hypoxic liver injury typically means that ALT is raised out of proportion to AST
- What is the Pringle manouevre? Clamp the hepatic ligament for haemostasis during surgery, or for an uncontrolled bleed. The hepatic ligament carries the portal vein, hepatic artery, and bike duct. Clamp for 10mins max then 5 mins off, and repeat if needed
- What does small for size (post-hepatic resection) mean? There is too much portal flow for the liver to cope with reactive hepatic artery constriction to compensate. This leads to cholestasis and ischaemia, and is worsened by concomitant sepsis. It is more common in males, elderly, and diabetics.
- Bleeding (Factor V discriminates Vitamin K deficiency from Liver disease)


# Ammonia metabolism

TODO: 2015-03-04 - [ ] summarise ammonia metabolism and the renal-liver cycle

- correct hypokalaemia (increases renal ammonia production from glutamine)
- NH3 acts as a respiratory stimulant so respiratory alkalosis is common

## Biochemical patterns of acute liver failure

### Paracetamol

Very high AST/ALT (>3500)
Low bilirubin
high INR

### Ischaemic

Very very high AST/ALT (25-250xULN), high LDH

### HBV

aminotransferases 1000-2000iu/l
ALT>AST

### Wilson's disease

aminotransferase <2000 iu/l
AST>ALT
Low ALP to bilirubin ratio (<4)
Rapidly progressive AKI
Low uric acid

### Acute Fatty Liver of pregnancy / HELLP

aminotransferases<1000 iu/l
high bilirubin
low platelets


## Summarise the management of encephalopathy in ALF

- Ammonia 
    + converted to glutamine which is osmotically active
    + >100 is a risk factor for intracranial hypertension
    + 55% of patients with ammonia > 200 micromol/l will develop intracranial hypertension
    + Rx for hyperammoniaemia (rifamixin) unproven
    + Rx with lactulose in ALF may be harmful (and causes bowel distension complicating transplant)
    + LOLA doesn't work (Acharya SK, Bhatia V, Sreenivas V et al.: Gastroenterology 136:2159, 2009)

- Minimise risk of intracranial hypertension (ICH)
    - uncommon if Grade 1/2
    - 25-75% at Grade 3/4
        + track pupils
    - run Na at 150
    - hypertonic saline for Grade 3/4 encephalopathy: hypertonic saline (30%) via infusion to maintain serum sodium levels of 145-155 mmol/L - significantly slowed onset of ICH (Murphy N, Auzinger G, Bernel W et al.: Hepatology 39:464, 2004)
    - bolus hypertonic saline (200ml 3% saline for sustained increases)

- Normothermia
    + hypothermia did not work either prophylactically or in response to ICH
    + hypothermia only in refractory cases

- ICP monitoring
    + risks: 2/92 patients - haemorrhage from bolt contributed to death (Vaquero J, Fontana RJ, Larson AM et al.: Liver Transpl 11:1581, 2005), and survival not shown to be different
    + Bernal and Wendon recommend monitoring only if ICH already suspected (not prophylactically) i.e. NH3>200 or sustained >150 and age<35 and concurrent renal or CVS failure

## Acute liver failure

## Definitions

- encephalopathy and INR >1.5 (impaired synthetic function in patient without pre-existing liver disease)
- illness < 6 months

## Epidemiology

- rare: est 1600 cases/yr in US
- aetiology
    + paracetamol (UK, US) (dose dependent drug reaction)
        * alcoholics
        * malnourished
        * patients on CYP450 inducers
    + hepatitis A,B,E
    + HBV, HSV etc in immunocompromised
    + idiosyncratic drug reactions
    + post-hepatectomy (small for size)
    + hypoxic ischaemic hepatitis
    + Pregnancy related
        * HELLP
        * Acute fatty liver of pregnancy
    + Idiopathic

- Note that acute HCV is rare

### UK epidemiology

Among 1014 patients with acute liver failure referred to King's College Hospital in the United Kingdom between 1973 and 1991, 57 percent were acetaminophen-induced, and 9 percent were attributable to hepatitis B or D

## Classification


## Prognostication

Spontaneous recovery is more likely with lower grades of encephalopathy [73]:

- Grade I to II – 65 to 70 percent
- Grade III – 40 to 50 percent
- Grade IV – <20 percent

MELD
King's College Criteria

## Critical care management

- Admit if at risk or significant encephalopathy (Grade 2+)
- Discuss with Kings

### Renal replacement therapy

- AKI common in paracetamol toxicity
- may be used to help control ammonia load and acid-base disturbances

### N-acetyl cysteine

- AST should fall by 50%/day, continue until <500
- beneficial in non-paracetamol ALF (Lee WM, Hynan LS, Rossaro L et al.: Gastroenterology 137:856, 2009)

### Antibiotics

> In the absence of an evidence base to guide practice, we administer antibiotics preemptively in patients who have coagulopathy and organ failure or encephalopathy and those in whom illness progression is considered likely.
-- Bernal and Wendon 2013, NEJM

- fluconazole: low index of suspicion for fungal infection

### Coagulopathy

- balanced loss of procoagulant and anticoagulant factors
- patient may be procoagulant
- functional testing ideal
- attempt to avoid correction of clotting factors

### Haemodynamics

- Consider sodium bicarbonate 1.26% as a resuscitation fluid
- Target CPP 60 mmHg
- Noradrenaline or vasopressin
- prophylactic PPI/H2-antagonists

### Nutrition

- glucose replacement if hypoglycaemic
- feed as usual (1 to 1.5g protein per kg per day) but reduce if unable to control ammonia or ICH

### Transplantation

- survival 79% at 1 year and 72% at 5 years
- deaths tend to be early in 1st 3 months and associated with infection

## Tips

- duration of NAC
- think about hepatitis serology when starting any immunosuppression
    + lamivudine
- falling phophate is a good thing (liver regeneration)
- don't track urea to monitor AKI in ALF (as production is decreased)
- correct hypokalaemia (increases renal ammonia production from glutamine)
- very high bilirubin can give false +ve paracetamol levels (so don't stop looking for other causes)


## Other complications

- Encephalopathy Grade 3/4 have GCS<8 and need intubating: Rx as raised ICP; Associated as mode of death
- Shunts: Splanchnic (hence hepatorenal) & Pulmonary (VQ mismatch)
- Ascites
- Renal Failure: Urinary Na<10 and U:P Creat >1 ... ie. Acute renal success 2ndry to splanchnic vasodilation
- Rx: midodrine (alpha1-agonist) & octeotride, terlipressin, albumin
- ARF in paracetamol overdose different and does not have the same terrible prognosis
- Impaired immunity
- Decreased complement synthesis therefore poor opsonisation of bacteria
- Kuppfler cells - poor endotoxin clearance
- Staph , E coli; often without fever/leucocytosis
- Intubation for CO2 control (ICP)/ airway protection more commonly than for hypoxia

# Miscellaneous and unsorted tips

## Anaphylaxis to N-acetylcysteine is overstated

Severe reactions requiring discontinuation of the infusion occured in around 1% of patients.

[Kerr F, Dawson A, Whyte IM et al. The Australasian Clinical Toxicology Investigators Collaboration randomized trial of different loading infusion rates of N-acetylcysteine. *Ann Emerg Med*. 2005;**45**:402-408.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2004.08.040)

## Distances from the nose and mouth for oral and nasal tubes

- Do not insert an NG tube further than 65cm
- The carina is roughly 30cm from the lips


## How do I manage anti-platelet therapy for a coronary stent?

Because of their dependence on anti-platelet therapy, coronary stents can be very difficult to manage in the critically ill patient.

There are three types (currently):

- Bare metal stents: a shorter period of 4-6 weeks dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT) but with a  higher 1 yr restenosis rate
- Drug eluting stents: a longer (minimum 1 year) period of DAT but with a lower 1 year restenosis. There is however then a higher late stenosis from failure of epithelialisation.
- Biocompatible stends: DAT period maybe as short as 1 week? Assume that these are expensive!

## Do I need to add fludricortisone (for its mineralocorticoid effects) when using hydrocortisone?

No. Hydrocortisone and cortisol have a similar affinity for aldosterone receptors, and at septic shock dose of hydorcortisone then there is no need for fludricortisone as there is sufficient mineralocorticod activity.


## Paediatric intubation

Kids have a big head and big occiput therefore put a thin folded blanket under the body so the head hangs down. This should afford a much better view, and make bag-valve-mask ventiltation much easier.

## CM5 monitoring

CM5 detects 89% of ST-segment changes due to left ventricular ischaemia.

Originally

- Right arm electrode on manubrium
- Left arm electrode on V5 and indifferent lead on left shoulder
- Switch to Lead I monitoring

More easily, stay with Lead II and move RA and indifferent electrodes to manubrium and V5 as above

## Tape or tie the LMA?

LMAs designed to require a small amount of downward pressure so tip sits in oesophageal sphincter and forms seal, ideally then tape LMAs don't tie but note the LMA supreme has a lip designed so that tying pushes the LMA down and improves seal.

## nt-proBNP does not diagnosis heart failure in patients with sepsis

Elevated nt-proBNP is seen in both patients with septic shock, and in those with acute heart failure.

[Rudiger A, Gasser S, Fischler M et al. Comparable increase of B-type natriuretic peptide and amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels in patients with severe sepsis, septic shock, and acute heart failure. *Crit Care Med*. 2006;**34**:2140-2144.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.CCM.0000229144.97624.90)


## Tips on using a chest x-ray for the diagnosis of pulmonary oedema

I struggle with this one. There is a nice exposition at [radiology assistant](http://www.radiologyassistant.nl/en/p4c132f36513d4/chest-x-ray-heart-failure.html).

Note
- supine chest films will show re-distribution of blood (upper lobe diversion) in the same way as high left atrial pressure does
- use the artery to bronchus ratio in an erect film
    + should be <1 above the hilum
    + should be <1 below the hilum
- look for Kerley-B lines. Because these represent oedema in the interstitium between the secondary lobules then these are not acutely dependent on the patient's position
- look for widening of the vascular pedicle (normal <60mm on a PA film in 90% of films) and an enlarged azygous vein


## How do I start to read an MRI?

Try and identify the parapharyngeal space because this is full of fat and is bright on T1 and dark on T2 and is the most helpful landmark; doesn't contain anything important itself. T2 vs T1 - best to look at white matter b/c CSF can be misleading; grey matter is bright in t2

### T2

- Pathology is bright
- Water is bright
- CSF is bright
- Fat is bright
- Flowing blood is bright

### STIR

- T2 with suppressed fat

### T1

- Pathology is mostly dark
- Gadolinium is bright
- Fat is bright
- CSF is dark


## Tricks for understanding and managing hypo- and hyper-natraemia

If the kidney's cannot concentrate urine and retain water (DI) ...

> maximally dilute urine, whether resulting from untreated diabetes insipidus, spontaneous recovery from hyponatremia, or administration of a vasopressin antagonist, will increase the plasma sodium concentration by about 2.5 mmol per liter per hour.

If the kidney's cannot excrete water (i.e. SIADH) ...

> In the absence of urinary loss of water, 1 ml of 3% saline per kilogram of body weight will increase the plasma sodium concentration by about 1 mmol per liter.

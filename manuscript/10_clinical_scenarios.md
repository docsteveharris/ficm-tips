# Clinical scenarios

## Should I cool a patient after cardiac arrest?

Currently this is controversial with conflicting evidence in the literature. However, there seems to be a consensus that _hyperthermia_ (T>36C)is harmful, and should be actively prevented.

Trials of therapeutic hypothermia (TH)

- [2002 NEJM](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=11856793): 275 patients after VF cardiac arrest showed better neurological outcomes and survival at 6 months. Very roughly the control arm had a 50% 6 month mortality and 50% poor neurological outcomes. Patients in the TH (32-34C) arm had roughly a 25% RR reduction in these outcomes
- [TTM trial, 2013 NEJM](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=24237006): 939 patients after cardiac arrest had a similar range of outcomes in the control arm, and _no_ difference in outcomes with the TH (32-34C)

Both trials achieved their temperature targets within 6--8 hours.

# Clinical scenarios

## Should I cool a patient after cardiac arrest?

Currently this is controversial with conflicting evidence in the literature. However, there seems to be a consensus that _hyperthermia_ (T>36C)is harmful, and should be actively prevented.

Trials of therapeutic hypothermia (TH)

- [2002 NEJM](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=11856793): 275 patients after VF cardiac arrest showed better neurological outcomes and survival at 6 months. Very roughly the control arm had a 50% 6 month mortality and 50% poor neurological outcomes. Patients in the TH (32-34C) arm had roughly a 25% RR reduction in these outcomes
- [TTM trial, 2013 NEJM](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=24237006): 939 patients after cardiac arrest had a similar range of outcomes in the control arm, and _no_ difference in outcomes with the TH (32-34C)

Both trials achieved their temperature targets within 6--8 hours.

### Other notes

- metabolism decreases 7-10% per degree C cooled below 37C, but shivering will increase metabolism by 40-100%
- Arrhythmia risk (VF/VT) increases below 28-30C
- myocardial contractility often increases!
- insulin resistance is common

## What are the most recent evidence based guidelines for acute pancreatitis (AP)?

These come from the [American College of Gastroenterology](http://gi.org/guideline/acute-pancreatitis/) in 2013.

- severe AP is defined by organ dysfunction lasting more than 48 hours
- early (within 24 hours) aggressive fluid resuscitation is recommended, but late fluids therapy should be moderated
- Abdominal ultrasound should be performed in all patients, but cross-sectional imaging should be reserved for those patient where the diagnosis is in doubt, or where the condition is not improving within the first 48-72 hours
- Routine drainage of asymptomatic necrosis or pseudocysts is _not_ recommended; where drainage is performed then, where possible, it should be deferred by 4 weeks. This permits liquification, and formation of a wall around the collection.
- Routine prophylactic antibiotics are _not_ recommended; where antibiotics are used, for infected necrosis, then the drug selected should have good tissue penetration

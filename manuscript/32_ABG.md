# Arterial blood gases

## Has there been appropriate respiratory compensation for a metabolic acidosis?

The following rules of thumb can be used to check.

- Does PaCO2 (in mmHg) = HCO_3_^-^ (mmol/l) + 15
- Does the PaCO2 approximate the decimal digits of the arterial pH (for example, if the pH is 7.25, then the pCO2 should be about 25 mmHg)

These rules work well for mild to moderately severe metabolic acidosis (HCO3 between 7 and 22 meq/L). For more severe metabolic acidosis (HCO3 less than 7 meq/L), the pCO2 should be maximally reduced to the 8 to 12 mmHg range. As an example, assume the following results are obtained in a patient with metabolic acidosis: pH = 7.30; pCO2 = 30 mmHg; HCO3 = 15 meq/L.

If the PaCO2 has not moved then there is a mixed metabolic-respiratory acidosis.

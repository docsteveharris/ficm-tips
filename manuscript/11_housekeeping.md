# Housekeeping

Much of medicine is simple, and can be broadly classed as 'housekeeping'. In critically ill patients, this is an especially broad category, because the more we take over and provide organ support, the less we are able to rely on normal homeostatic mechanisms. You and I, for example, never lie perfectly still when we sleep. Sedated critically ill patients however do exactly that, and without excellent nursing develop pressure ulcers.

## Should oral or IV potassium replacement be preferred?

The two routes are equivalent, but we are rightly cautious about rapid IV replacement because of the risk of arrhythmias. Oral replacement, when absorption is possible, is at least as effective.

T> ### Rules of thumb
T>
T> - Peripheral IV fluids should never contain more than 40mmol/l K^+^
T> - Peripheral IV fluids should not be administered more quickly than 20 mmol/l K^+^ per hour without monitoring in a critical care area.
T> - Higher concentrations of IV potassium may be administered centrally with 40 mmol/hour as a sensible upper limit with cardiac monitoring.
T> - 40 meq of oral KCl will increase serum K by 0.5--0.7 meq/l over 1--2 hours (1 tablet of 'Sando-K' contains 12 meq of K so expect three tablets to give you a 0.5mmol/l increase)

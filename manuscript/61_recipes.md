## Recipes for critical care

These can either be based on patients or scenarios.

Here is a proposed list

Patient recipes
- post-op major surgery: warm, wean, wake
- post-op major surgery: brief period of ventilation required
- head injury
- major trauma without head injury
- neutropaenic sepsis (not requiring immediate ventilation)
- co-amilo-frusi-neb: old non-specifically unwell but could be labelled chest sepsis if you want to stop thinking
- acute pancreatitis: one of the commoner clear diagnoses
- post cardiac arrest
- ventilated so long you can't remember the initial reason for admission
- post-abdominal sepsis

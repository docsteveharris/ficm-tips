## Respiratory support

### Barotrauma

Remember that peak pressure is just a proxy for regional lung overdistension. High pleural pressure will mitigate (e.g. the trumpet player, or the obese patient), and diseased lung will exacerbate since the regional differences will be greater and the proportion of the lung ventilated will be smaller thereby increasing the risk to the healthy compliant lung.

Distinguish 'volutrauma' resulting from overdistension, and 'atelectrauma' that arises from repetitive shearing stress occuring by ventilating at low _absolute_ total lung volumes. This is the underlying rationale for high PEEP and recruitment manouevres supported by a recent meta-analysis:

[Briel M, Meade M, Mercat A et al. Higher vs Lower Positive End-Expiratory Pressure in Patients With Acute Lung Injury and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. *JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association*. 2010;**303**:865.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2010.218)
)


#### Basic science literature

- [PEEP is protective even with high peak airway pressures]([Webb HH, Tierney DF. Experimental pulmonary edema due to intermittent positive pressure ventilation with high inflation pressures. Protection by positive end-expiratory pressure. *Am Rev Respir Dis*. 1974;**110**:556-565
)
- [Animals with binders around chest and abdomen did not develop lung oedema despite high airway pressures]([Dreyfuss D, Soler P, Basset G et al. High inflation pressure pulmonary edema. Respective effects of high airway pressure, high tidal volume, and positive end-expiratory pressure. *Am Rev Respir Dis*. 1988;**137**:1159-1164.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm/137.5.1159)
)
- [Volutrauma can be induced with spontaneous ventilation]([Mascheroni D, Kolobow T, Fumagalli R et al. Acute respiratory failure following pharmacologically induced hyperventilation: an experimental animal study. *Intensive Care Med*. 1988;**15**:8-14
)

### Why is oesophageal pressure not used to guide mechanical ventilation?

Firstly, what is the evidence for this?

[Talmor D, Sarge T, Malhotra A et al. Mechanical ventilation guided by esophageal pressure in acute lung injury. *N Engl J Med*. 2008;**359**:2095-2104.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa0708638)
    - 2008 RCT Beth Israel Deaconess stopped prematurely because of reached its pre-specified stopping criteria for improved effect (approx 10kPa improval in the P:F ratio)
    - oesophageal pressure group
        + used transpulmonary 'PEEP' ladder between 0-10cm based on FiO2; this typically led to much higher more prolonged use of PEEP (17 vs 10cmH2O at 72 hours)
        + less 'dead space' in this group by the end of the study implying better V:Q matching
        + trend to improved 28 and 180 day mortality
    - control group followed standard ARDSnet PEEP ladder
    - both groups kept tidal volume below 6ml/kg IBW
    - 

Is it difficult to do?

- balloon catheter inserted to 60cm from the incisor to measure gastric pressure then withdrawn to 40cm for oesophageal pressure measurements

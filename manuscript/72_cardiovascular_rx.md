## Cardiovascular drugs

### Inotropes

- Divide into cAMP dependent mechanisms and cAMP independent mechanisms
    -cAMP independent: alpha-1, Na/Ca exchange inhibitors, K channel inhibition, Ca salts (gluconate etc), Thyroid hormone, Glucose/K/Insulin
    -cAMP dependent: catecholamines, PDE inhibitors, direct adenyl cyclase activation (forskolin)

#### Catecholamines

- Structure Activity Relationships demonstrated (ie methylation of amine (adrenaline, isoprenaline) incr Beta-activity
    - *Noradrenaline*: Alpha1(+++)Beta1(+): Potent vasoconstrictor, pulmonary and venoconstriction too; Combines with vasodilators ("Canadian Cocktail"(?))
    - *Adrenaline*: Alpha1(++); Beta1(++); Beta2(++); mild vasopressor at low dose and minimal HR effect in low/medium dose (??); inopressor effect; combines with vasodilators; more potent wrt cAMP increase cf all other catecholamines
    - *Dobutamine*: Beta1(+++); Beta2(+); gold standard inotrope; improve contractility and BP; incr HR in all patients (unless severe CHF); benign effect on MvO2; little effect on peripheral vasculature; combines well with PDE inhibitors; 5-20mcg/kg/min
    - *Dopamine*: DA1(+++); alpha1(+/+++); Beta1(++); Beta2(+); CNS effects and metabolic handling in critically ill hence controversial use in sepsis; otherwise effective inotrope that combines well with vasodilators
    - *Isoprenaline*: Beta1(+); Beta2(+++); original inodilator - marked chronotropisms; BP often falls until filling restored; Pulmonary vasodilator (useful in PHT); Contraindicated in IHD; 0.25-5mcg/kg/min
- Beware mixing catecholamines - competition for receptors (ie dobutamine will antagonise adrenalines ability to incr cAMP)
- Loading doses not needed

#### Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors

- Potent ionodilators; Combine well with catecholamines to enhance cAMP while minimising peripheral vasodilation; 
- Best for surgical patients with hypertensive heart disease/CHF; Evidence of synergism and benefit for amrinone/adrenaline combination post-CABG

- Different pharmacokinetics - need loading dose ie milrinone (50mcg/kg over 30mins) then 0.5ug/kg/min
- Inhibition of isoenzyme family III - +ve inotropy; unchanged or decr O2 demand 2- decr SVR and decr LV work; reflex tachycardia
- Hypotension often v difficult to treat; requires volume loading and vasoconstrictors

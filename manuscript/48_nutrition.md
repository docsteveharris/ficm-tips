## Nutrition

### What is the evidence for feeding (or the evidence for harm with underfeeding)?

You first of all need to define what normal feed requirement are:

- Energy 4:2:1 (or 25kcal/kg/d) with 2:1 ratio of CBH (4kcal/g) to Lipid (9kcal/g); Protein 1g/kg/day (4kcal/g (and 0.2g N2/g) protein)other electrolytes
- Need 1kcal/kg/hr and 1ml H2O /kg/hr (ie 4/2/1 works for fluids and calories!)
Simple formulae OK; complicated formulae or indirect calorimetry do not appear to improve outcome


#### Evidence


[The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Clinical Trials Network. Initial Trophic vs Full Enteral Feeding in Patients With Acute Lung Injury: The EDEN Randomized Trial. JAMAâ€¯: the journal of the American Medical Association. 2012;307(8):795-803. doi:10.1001/jama.2012.137.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3743415/)
	- EDEN trial by ARDS network in 1000 ventilated adults with ALI diagnosed within 3d
    - Full vs trophic feeding started within 48h and continued for 6d
    	- Full feed:  25 to 30 kcal/kg per day of nonprotein calories and 1.2 to 1.6 g/kg per day of protein; achieved around 80% of caloric targets 
        - Trophic: 20kcal/h; achieved around 20% of caloric targets 
    - No difference in ventilator free days, infection or 60 day mortality but less GI intolerance in trophic group (and maybe less vasopressor use, lower PaCO2 and bicarb)
    - Note that mean weight and BMI were 85kg and 30 kg/m2 respectively so not clear that these results can be applied to underweight patients
    - Note that first week cumulative fluid balance around neutral in the trophic group but full group run similarly dry with mean cumulative balance of 2000ml total

    - EPanIC
    - 2007-2010 European RCT approx 5000 patients
    - Parenteral group started glucose 20% for the first 48 hours, then switched to TPN to supplement EN from day 3 until EN was 80% of target. These patients achieved 100% of target by day 3-4.
    - Enteral group received glucose 5% in an equivalent volume to the glucose 20% or TPN that would have been administered in the parenteral group, and did not receive TPN before day 8
    - Enteral nutrition was started for all patients after 48 hours if oral intake was not possible
    - Tight glycaemic control was performed for all patients
    - No difference in ICU, hospital, or 90-mortality
    - Faster discharge and less organ support in the late (enteral) group
    - More infections, and inflammation (CRP) in the parenteral group

    - Calories: similar results to EPanIC
    - No difference in patient outcomes between those randomised to early initial TPN vs early initial EN
    - marked cost savings for the EN group
    - tolerance of below target feeding in both groups

[Martin CM, Doig GS, Heyland DK et al. Multicentre, cluster-randomized clinical trial of algorithms for critical-care enteral and parenteral therapy (ACCEPT). *CMAJ*. 2004;**170**:197-204
    - Late 1990's Canadian cluster randomised controlled trial with around 200+ patients per arm
    - Intervention group received greater training in delivering nutrition
    - small increases in overall nutrition in the protocol arm with earlier use, more calories and greater use of parenteral nutrition
    - small improvement in mortality


### Is there harm from overfeeding?

- in terms of total calories
- in terms of protein



### How might feeding cause diarrhoea in the critical ill patient?

TODO: 2015-03-12 - [ ]
- little evidence that low volume/ high calorie feeds are resposible
- elemental feeds used to include single amino acids and hence were hyper-osmolar, but now they contain short peptides and diarrhoea is rare
-

### What supplements should be included with nutritional support?

#### Do _not_ include glutamine

Glutamine is metabolised into glutamate and ammonia. The theoretical argument is that catabolic patients require glutamine for nucleotide synthesis, but there is evidence of harm with supplementation.

Previous studies had suggested there was benefit ('immunonutrition') as glutamine provided direct nutrition to small bowel enterocytes and lymphoid tissue.

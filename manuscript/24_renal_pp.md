# Renal physiology and pathology

## Renal pearls

- a urine Na+ concentration below 20 meq/L is generally indicative of hypovolemia
- two major causes of hyponatremia are effective volume depletion and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). The urine Na+ concentration should be low in the former, but greater than 40 meq/L in the SIADH, which is characterized by water retention but normal Na+ handling (ie, equal to intake)
- FeNa = urine:plasma sodium / u:p creatinine should be < 1% ie top number small, bottom big

## Should I use NAC for prophylaxis of contrast induced nephropathy?

No. Renal association do not recommend NAC. Either bicarbonate or NaCl at 1ml/kg over 12 hrs.

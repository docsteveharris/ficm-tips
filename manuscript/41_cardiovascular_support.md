# Cardiovascular support

## Balloon pumps

IABP efficiency is determined by:

- Timing of balloon inflation and deflation
- Assist ratio (e.g. 1:1 – balloon inflation and deflation on every cardiac cycle – provides greater circulatory assistance than 1:2 or 1:4 – balloon inflation and deflation on every 2nd or 4th cardiac cycle )
- Heart rate (efficiency is greatly decreased at heart rates >130/min)
- Gas loss from balloon (balloon volume)
- Minimum cardiac index of 1.2 – 1.4 L/min/m2 is required for IABP assistance to be clinically beneficial


IABP should be adjusted so that the following criteria are met

- inflation of the balloon occurs at the dicrotic notch (forming the sharp ‘V’)
- the slope of rise of augmented diastolic waveform is straight and parallel to the systolic upstroke
- the augmented DBP at balloon deflation exceeds or is equal to end-systolic BP
- the end-diastolic BP at balloon deflation is lower than the preceding unassisted end-DBP by 15-20 mmHg
- the assisted SBP (following a cycle of balloon inflation) is lower than the previous unassisted SBP by 5 mmHg

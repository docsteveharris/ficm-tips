# Respiratory physiology and pathology

## What changed in the 2012 Berlin definition of ARDS?

The new Berlin definition replaced the 1994 American-European Consensus Conference definition. The following is a distilled summary:

- exclude alternatives: cardiogenic and other causes of respiratory failure must have been excluded. Objective evidence of preserved cardiac function is required if there are no risk factors for ARDS.
- demonstrate an acute course: new or worsened disease within a week
- Bilateral radiographic changes: not otherwise explained
- a low PF ratio with CPAP or PEEP {$$}\geq5cmH_{2}O{/$$}
    + Mild: PF ratio 200-300mmHg (27--40kPa)
    + Moderate: PF ratio 100-200 mmHg (13-27kPa)
    + Severe: PF ratio â‰¤100mmHg (13kPa)
- Pulse oximetry can be used instead of arterial blood gas analysis via S:F ratios:
    + 200mmHg (27kPa) = 235
    + 300mmHg (40kPa) = 315

The main differences were from the 1994 definition were

- the inclusion of PEEP
- abandoning ALI (Acute Lung Injury) as a label

## Should I use inhaled nitric oxide in severe respiratory failure?

Two meta-analyses attempted to answer this question, and found that while NO improves oxygenation, there is no improvement in outcome. This mirrors the concept that it is not the severity of ARDS (as measured by PF rations) that determines outcome.

As usual, despite the lack of an average population benefit, the question of individual benefit remains unresolved. You might consider the use of inhaled NO in

- patients with high pulmonary vascular resistance
- in 'responders': this means trying NO and

Also note

- there is evidence of increased renal failure
- there is stronger evidence in children
- tachyphylaxis occurs
- [consider as rescue therapy for acute right ventricular failure following PE](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16598645)
- inhaled prostacyclin as an alternative that is much easier to administer

## When to initiate glucocorticoids in ARDS?

T> ### Rule of thumb
T>
T> Do _not_ start steroids _after_ the first 2 weeks of ARDS.


The literature is not clear. The ARDS network trial suggested benefit if started during the second week, and harm if started later. The 'Meduri' trial suggested benefit when started within 72 hours of the onset of disease.

Typical treatment regimes are 1mg/kg of methylprednisolone per day for at least 7 days.

## Summarise the principles of ventilation in acute asthma

There are some widely recognised principles for the use of mechanical ventilation in asthma based on the problems arising from dynamic hyperinflation of the lungs. These are reviewed here because some of the principles are counter-intuitive (favouring a higher respiratory rate for a given minute volume) and context dependent (the application of external Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP)).

- the blood PaCO~2~ and therefore the pH depends on the metabolic rate and the alveolar ventilation. The metabolic rate is increased in severe asthma because of the increased work of breathing which arises from increased airways resistance, the mechanical disadvantage of the thorax when hyper-inflated, and patient anxiety. Sedation, and paralysis, and mechanical ventilation remove some of the metabolic demand. During invasive positive pressure ventilation (PPV), a degree of hypercarbia is tolerated.

- alveolar emptying is a passive process and the optimum physical conditions for this for a given level of alveolar ventilation are maximised by (Tuxen, 1987)

    - increasing the respiratory rate rather than the tidal volume
    - prolonging the expiratory phase which can either be achieved by decreasing the respiratory rate, or prolonging the inspiratory:expiratory (I:E) ratio.
    - minimise PEEP during mandatory PPV (Oddo, 2006) which will in turn maximise the pressure gradient driving expiratory flow. When using a spontaneous mode, external PEEP should be set at around 80% of the measured intrinsic value otherwise abnormally negative intra-pleural pressures must be generated by the patient in order to trigger a breath. This means that PEEP might be used initially during non-invasive ventilation prior to invasive PPV, then removed immediately after intubation, and started again during weaning.

    Because flow decreased exponentially, then extending the I:E ratio beyond 1:4 is unlikely to be helpful.(Leatherman, 2004)  The respiratory rate set is normally a compromise between these two aims, without immediately trying to correct hypercapnoea.

- maintain a high index of suspicion for pneumothoraces
- minimise the external dead space of the breathing circuit, and in particular using a heated water humidifier rather than a Heat & Moisture Exchanger (HME)]

## Weaning pearls

- Try alternating periods of weaning with periods of cuff-down (with pressure support and PEEP) to give patients a voice, and a chance to re-learn their upper airway reflexes
- When decannulating then step down to NIV and do not discharge without a follow-up package on the ward
- PaCO2 Should not be allowed to rise; the tenet that if the pH is OK then ignore the PaCO2 is wrong. Don't use the permissive hypercapnoea argument when weaning; it's a sign of the patient not being ready, and there still being stuff that needs fixing. For example, nearly all patients on the Lane-Fox unit at GSTT, will be managed with a normal PaCO2.
- Hyoscine is OK for secretions because it only really affects the upper airway, and therefore makes little difference to the viscosity and clearance of lower airway secretions

# Radiology

## Background

- fluoroscopy in theatre exposed staff to around 0.01mSv (milliSieverts) when lead aprons are _not_ worn whereas a chest x-ray delivers around 0.02mSv. A CT abdomen delivers 800-1000 times that dose (8-10mSv)  which is associated with a 1 in 2000-2500 lifetime cancer risk!

## Chest radiographs

### Basics

- Patient position (look for 'inclinometers: patient supine or upright, and some with dots that indicated the angle of the head of the bed')
- lung volumes: should see 10 ribs (count posterior, and remember that commonly the first seen behind the right apex is the third)
- Well centred? Spinous process between medial head of clavicle
- well penetrated? (just) see intervertebral disc spaces through mediastinum

### Line position

- tip of central lines should be at the caval-atrial border (where bronchus intermedius crosses above right side of heart); note this is lower than alternative recommendation of between clavicles and carina
- ETT tubes: 2--6cm above carina (and below the clavicular heads)
- carina should be at T6 level (and can sometimes be found by drawing a 45 degree line from the aortic knuckle)

### Locating abnormalities

Think anterior and posterior in terms of silhouettes

- ie descending aorta is posterior so check for silhouette to define a-p position on left? @good
- ditto with hilum
- Right middle lobe is anterior with heart hence silhouette affects right heart border
- right lower lobe is a posterior and sits on diaphragm hence lose diaphragm
- left upper lobe is anterior
- left lower lobe posterior

## Abdominal radiographs

- large bowel should be less than 9cm, peripheral, haustra which do not cross the bowel
- small bowel should be less than 3cm, central, valvulae conniventes are close together and cross the bowel

## CT chest

Set-up your windows by using Hounsfield units:
    1. Set as window width (WW)
    2. Set window level (WL) which represents the midpoint is midpoint

Useful Hounsfield values

- 0 is water
- -1000 is air
- 3000 is bone
- fat -100 to -50
- blood 30-45
- soft tissue is approx 80 (this is the typical window setting on

CT chest types

+ non-contrast for lung parenchyma
+ high res (HRCT) for ILD (1-1.5mm slices)
+ contrast for mediasteinum and pleura

### Terminology

+ reticular
+ nodular
+ high attenuation (bright densities)
    * ground glass (GGO): less dense increase which does not obscure the vessels
    * consolidation: dense increase in opacity, obscures vessels
+ low attenuation (low densities)
    * emphysema
    * cystic lung disease

### CT anatomy

+ secondary lobules key for understanding disease
    * 1--2cm in diameter
    * made up ofr 5--15 acini
    * surrounded by lymphatics and pulmonary veins that return in the interlobular septae
    * centred on terminal bronchiole: accompanied by pulmonary artery - centrilobular artery

![secondary pulmonary lobule]({{base.url}}/assets/media/150215_secondary_pulmonary_lobule.png)

+ centrilobular area is site for diseases that enter via the airways
+ perilymphatics - peripheral part and pathology follows the lymphatics
    * septial thicknening = reticular pattern
        - smooth - fluid
        - nodular: silicosis, sarcoidosis
        - NB: lymphangitic carcinomatosis can create either process

Classification follows from anatomy
- dominant pattern (reticular, nodular etc)
- distribution wrt to 2ndary lobule (centrilobular vs perilymphatic, random)
    + e.g. centriobular: in the centre of the connective tissue margins of the secondary lobule (look for space between nodule and pleura)
        * hypersensitivity pneumonitis
        * infectious disease
        * brnochioalveolar cancer
        * NB: an extension of this is 'tree in bud' sign where the terminal bronchiole is inflamed and thickened - think TB, CF, bronchiectasis, ABPA; i.e. inflammation of distal airways)
    + e.g. perilymhatic: along edges
    + random: miliary TB, fungi, metastases
- distribution wrt lung (upper zone, lower, central, peripheral)
    + upper vs lower
    + central vs peripheral

- GGO
    + acute: pulmonary oedema, ARDS, pneumonia (esp viral)
    + chronic: hypersensitivity pneumonitis; alveolar proteinoisis
- High attenuation: pus, oedema, blood or cancer
    + think in terms of acute vs chronic
- Low attenuation
    + bronchiectasis (dilated bronchioles)
    + cavities (walls greater than 4mm)
        * final stages = honeycombing (differential: interstitial lung disease including drugs and connective tissue)
            - see associated traction bronchiectasis
    + cysts (walled areas <4mm)
    + emphysema (not walled)
        * paraseptal: adjacent to the pleura and interlobar fissures
            - young adults with spontaneous pneumothorax
            - also seen in older smokers (spectrum of centrilobular below)
        * panlobular: affects whole lobulue but lower lobes >> upper lobes
            - think alpha-1 anti-trypsin
            - smokers with advanced emphysema
        * centrilobular
            - most common
            - upper lobe predominance
            - uneven distribution
            - smokers

## Excessive fluid loading in theatre can be harmful

Restrive regimen
- no preloading
- no replacement for estimated third space losses
- fast replacement 500ml 5% dex (less any oral fluids taken during fast)
- blood loss replaced 1:1 with starch
- post-op 1000ml 5% dex
- post-op furosemide given if weight increased by >1kg from baseline (the liberal group gained 2--3 kg of fluid weight post-operatively)

## Notes on fluid management in the critical care

### Compartments & Electrolytes

Understand 1st the physiology of fluid compartments (and also what defines those compartments: Starling Forces, Gibbs-Donnan equilibrium; van't Hoff equation; excluded volume effect)

- ICF: 30l (55% of TBW)(Idiogenic moles, Na 10, K140, Ca2+ 0.0001, Cl 10, HCO3- 10, Protein 132mmol/l, H+ 80/pH 7.2)
- ECF: 10l (fast) 15l (slow): Na 140, K4, Ca2+ 1.5, Cl 118, HCO3- 24, Protein 10mmol/l, H+ 40/pH 7.4)
- Plasma 3l (40ml/kg): Protein 50-80g (Albumin 45g / 0.6mmol/l ~66% total oncotic pressure; MW 70000; Normal rate of transfer to ISF is 5%/hr  producing ~18g/l in ISF but in sepsis ~15% hour); Plasma oncotic pressure 25-28mmHg cf. total osmotic pressure 5500mmHg
- Blood Volume 5l (70ml/kg)

- Maintenance: 4:2:1. then around 10ml/kg/hr during body cavity surgery + losses
How much?
Absolute Amount need to estimate IBW= 50kg for 5ft then add/subtract ~2kg per inch after that
Next estimate TBW: ~ 60% (80%. Neonates, 45-50% eldery )
Water Will be distributed throughout TBW lest Vd ~ 60Oml/kg  / ~ 32l)
Saline (+ crystalloid) will be distributed throughout ECF lest. Vd ~ 150ml/kg ~ 10l )

Colloid (incl. blood) will be distributed throughout lVF (ie. plasma volume 45ml/kg ie. 3000ml)

### What fluid?

- Normal Saline (154mmol Na/Cl: Osm 308; pH 5 (?reaction with plastic); strong ion effect b/c incr chloride concentration hence decr SID hence acidify
- Hartmann's (Na 131, K 5, Ca 2, Cl 111, Lactate 29; Osm 278; pH 6.5): Lactate Metabolism (Cori cycle: liver capacity 100mmol/hr so >3l/hr might lead to incr lactate? Calorific value?)
- Dextrose 5%: 50g dextrose (200kcal); Osm 278; pH 4; Maximum glucose administration rate 5mg/kg/min (~10g/hr) else hyperglycaemia hence keep infusion rate below 200ml/hr)
- Gelatin MW 30 000 (Na 154, Cl 125, pH 7.4): Succinylated = Gelatin; Urea Linked = Haemacell; Anaphylaxis 1/5-10 000; unlimited dose (fr BSE free bovine collagen)
- Hydroxyethyl starchs (from maize): degree of substitution determines persistence (amylase breaks down);  (~80 000): Hetastarch DS0.7, Pentastarch DS0.5, Tetrastarch DS0.4 (voluven: spread of MW narrower in voluven); dose limit 30-50ml/kg/d (Note this is roughly one plasma volume!); Anaphylaxis 1/20000; Clotting, renal impairment, itch
- Dextrans (bacterial produce branched polysaccharides fr. sucrose): Dextran 40 (MW40k) - interferes with plt activity, plasminogen activator & decr FVIII levels; prolongs bleeding time: dose 20ml/kg D1 then 10ml/kg x5d max; anaphylaxis 1/20000; Dexran 70 (MW70k)

### Assessment:

- Haematocrit best way of following IVF (assuming no haemorrhage: good for ICU not in theatre)

### Clinical Situations

- Haemorrhage: Volume resus (crystalloid ~10% remains in IVF; redistribution rate constant ~5mins: i.e.persists max 15mins)
- Standard Maintenance: NCEPOD (ward maintenace fluid poorly prescribed: incr mortality)
- Fluids in sepsis: FACCT trial (7d fluid intervention FB 0+furosemide vs FB7000: shorter time on vent over 60d)
- Flaps & Microcirculatory "optimisation": dextrans, colloids
- Perioperative Fluids: Brandstrup 2003 Danish fluids incr morbidity>5l/d; Preload guidance with doppler (Noblett 2006)



Paediatrics: Hypoglycaemia (overstated: neonates and those on TPN / ward dextrose only); hyponatraemia bigger problem; periop fluid (Hartmann's but maybe 75% 4:2:1 maintenance b/c ADH) + 100% losses); ward maintenance dex/saline; pyloric stenosis replace with normal or half normal saline (K20, +glucose)

# Chloride restriction

Chloride-restrictive fluids
Many of the solutions used for fluid resuscitation in critically-ill patients are hyperchloremic (eg, isotonic saline, 4 percent albumin solution in saline) relative to plasma. It has been hypothesized that increased chloride concentration leads to renal vasoconstriction and decreased glomerular filtration, raising the possibility that the chloride concentration of intravenous fluids might adversely affect renal outcomes in ICU patients. In a prospective, open-label, observational study, the use of chloride-restrictive intravenous fluids (eg, lactated Hartmann solution, Plasma-Lyte 148, chloride-poor albumin) was compared with standard intravenous fluids (eg, isotonic saline) in consecutive ICU patients treated during two separate six month periods separated by a six-month hiatus [49]. The mean serum creatinine increases during the control and chloride-restrictive periods were 22.6 μmol/L (95% CI, 17.5-27.7) and 14.8 μmol/L (95% CI, 9.8-19.9), respectively. The need for renal replacement therapy was also less among patients treated with chloride-restrictive fluids. Due to the nonrandomized design of the study and other methodologic problems, further studies are needed before a change in practice to use of chloride-restrictive intravenous fluids can be recommended [50].

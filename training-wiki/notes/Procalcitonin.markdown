Procalcitonin has been studied prospectively to facilitate the decision of whether to use antibacterial agents in patients with pneumonia and when antibiotics can be safely stopped. In two trials, clinicians were strongly recommended not to prescribe antibacterials in patients with a procalcitonin level <0.1 mcg/L, but were encouraged to use antibacterials in patients with levels >0.25 mcg/L [62,63]. The analysis suggested the correct decision in 83 percent [63]. Several trials have shown that using procalcitonin results to help determine whether antibiotics are necessary results in lower rates of antibiotic exposure [62-64].

In a Cochrane meta-analysis that used individual patient data from 14 trials of 4221 patients with acute respiratory infections (half of whom had CAP), procalcitonin guidance for antibiotic use was associated with a reduction in antibiotic exposure (from a median of eight days to four days) without an increase in mortality or treatment failure in any clinical setting (eg, outpatient clinic, emergency department) or in patients with any type of acute respiratory infection, including CAP [65]. Most patients with a diagnosis of CAP supported by imaging showing a pulmonary infiltrate will be treated with an antibiotic, but a low procalcitonin may support the impression of a viral or other nonbacterial cause. The procalcitonin may also facilitate the decision to stop antibiotics since the levels reflect bacterial replication. We consider procalcitonin a useful adjunct to the antibiotic decisions in CAP, but other observations and clinical judgment are also important.

Other studies have shown that procalcitonin levels correlate with the severity of pneumonia [66,67]. In one small study, procalcitonin levels increased over time in non-survivors but decreased in survivors [67]. Procalcitonin levels also predict bacteremia [68]. These studies show that procalcitonin levels help to distinguish between bacterial and viral pneumonia, reduce antibacterial use, predict severity based on the magnitude of the result, and may predict survival.

The use of procalcitonin for distinguishing between bacterial and viral bronchitis is discussed in detail separately. (See "Acute bronchitis in adults", section on 'Procalcitonin'.)

## Clinical questions

- What is the [[HaemofiltrationDose|best haemofiltration dose]]?

## Notes

- RRT needed when GFR<15ml/min : in RRT Need Filtration Rate / Dialysate exceed this (averaged over the day/week including times when machine not running) i.e. 15ml/min = 900ml/hr 

- Dialysis:(diffusion); small molecules only;  (Fick's Law: Flow proportional to area x concentration (or) partial pressure difference x solubility coefficient / (membrane thickness x âˆšMW)); cellulose based membrane with low permeability to water; cellulose membrane tends to inflammatory so not used in ICU; Clearance (ml/min) = dialysis flow rate (assumes equilibration)
- Filtration: (convection/bulk flow), small and medium molecules (<20kDa): synthetic membrane with high permeability to water; solute transfer depends on bulk flow; convection depends on balance of pressures across membrane (CVVH this is provided by pump cf. old arterial-venous systems); membrane filters anything <20kDa which includes inflammatory middle molecules (IL1, endotoxin, PAF, IL1, IL8) and (heparin, pesticides, ammonia, and drugs not bound to plasma proteins); Clearance (ml/min) = filtration fraction (FF x Venous Access Rate)
- Venous access rate (i.e. organ flow, proportion of cardiac output!) 0-300ml/min; some 700ml/min
- Filtration Fraction (FF) keep <20% if Hct~30% else haemoconcentrate+++ and filter clots; i.e. Venous access rate is 300ml/min and FF20% then Filtration Rate = 60ml/min = 3600ml/hr
- Filtration Rates normally quoted per kg from 20-35ml/kg/hr 
- Fluid replacement normally post filter unless problems with clotting then can replace pre-filter (but less efficient)
- Vascular Access: arterial pressure fistula's used in CRF as can "needle a fistula" and get suitable flow rates through small bore needle vs. wide bore vascaths needed to give suitable flow rates when using venous pressure systems ("arterial" side collects blood from side ports and "venous" side returns blood distally to avoid recirculation)
- Membranes activate intrinsic system ((Factor XII, negatively charged surfaces) so need anticoagulation: flush filter pre-use with heparin 5000U in 2000ml then 1000U bolus into intake port then run at 300-500U/hr for APPT 1.5-2.0 (or) prostacyclin if platelets low (but beware vasodilate so anticipate MAP falls 15mmHg)

## Replacement Fluids
- Bicarbonate is filtered therefore must be replaced but bicarb in solution ppts with Ca/Mg and dissociates into CO2 and diffuses out so lactate normally used instead as liver converts to bicarb (can metabolise 100mmol/hr in health)
- Alternatives are 
	- bicarbonate buffered fluid but with no Ca/Mg and locally prepared so 'fresh' 
	- Or lactate/bicarbonate free but bicarb infused seperately to replace

## Evidence in RRT

- Ronco, Lancet 2000: High volume (>35) vs Low (20) ml/kg/hr ultrafiltrate had better outcomes: Need >40 to have a significant effect on concentrations of inflammatory mediators (Cole, Crit Care Med, 2002)
- Gettings, Inten Care Med, 1999: Early RRT better than late in trauma

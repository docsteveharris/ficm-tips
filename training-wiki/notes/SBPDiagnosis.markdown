Appropriate handling of the ascitic fluid is crucial to minimize the risk of skin flora contaminating the cultures. Appropriate handling of the ascitic fluid is also required to minimize the risk of obtaining a falsely negative culture, possibly leading to the diagnosis of culture-negative neutrocytic ascites (ie, ascites with a PMN count ≥250 cells/mm3, but with negative cultures of the ascitic fluid) [6]. Most patients with culture-negative neutrocytic ascites actually have SBP. (See "Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis variants".)

The ascitic fluid should be tested for the following:

Aerobic and anaerobic culture
Cell count and differential
Gram stain
Albumin
Protein
Glucose
Lactate dehydrogenase
Amylase
Bilirubin (if the fluid is dark orange or brown)
Typically, two 20 mL syringes of ascitic fluid will be needed for the above tests.

If tuberculous peritonitis is suspected, additional fluid should be obtained and sent for an acid fast bacteria smear and Mycobacterial culture. However, these tests will frequently fail to detect tuberculous peritonitis, so if there is high suspicion, peritoneoscopy with Mycobacterial culture and histology of a biopsied tubercle are the most rapid route to the diagnosis. (See "Tuberculous peritonitis", section on 'Peritoneal fluid analysis'.)

Culture
Cultures should be sent in blood culture bottles. At least two bottles (one for aerobic and one for anaerobic culture) should be inoculated immediately at the bedside using a new, sterile needle. A needle that has passed through the skin should not be used to inoculate the bottles because it may lead to contamination of the sample with skin flora. Ideally, at least 10 mL of fluid should be introduced into each bottle.

We use the following approach when obtaining ascitic fluid cultures:

Immediately prior to the paracentesis, we wipe the top of each blood culture bottle with an alcohol wipe and leave the wipe on the bottle top in an attempt to maintain sterility while the paracentesis is being performed.
During the paracentesis, a 20 mL syringe is connected to the needle that is in the abdominal wall and filled with ascitic fluid. Additional syringes are filled to obtain fluid for additional testing (eg, cell count and chemistries), and if needed, to increase the volume of fluid obtained for culture.
Immediately after the paracentesis, a new, sterile needle should be placed on the 20 mL syringe. The new needle can be used to inoculate multiple bottles. However, each syringe should have its own new needle. This is to decrease the risk of a needle-stick injury that could occur if the needle is transferred among syringes.
The alcohol wipes are removed and the blood culture bottles are inoculated, preferably with at least 10 mL of ascitic fluid each. However, some bottles will not permit more than the recommended amount of fluid to be instilled without infringing upon the "head space" in the bottle, in which case the upper end of the recommended amount of fluid should be instilled.
If tuberculous peritonitis is suspected, ascitic fluid should be sent to the lab as per local procedure.
The blood culture bottles are sent to the microbiology laboratory immediately for both aerobic and anaerobic culture.
It is important to use blood culture bottles because SBP is a low-colony-count monomicrobial infection similar to bacteremia. If a syringe or tube of fluid is sent to the laboratory for culture, the sensitivity for detecting SBP is dramatically decreased [6-8]. Culturing ascitic fluid as if it were blood (with immediate bedside inoculation of ascitic fluid into blood culture bottles) has been shown to increase the culture-positivity of the ascitic fluid. In a study of patients with an ascitic fluid PMN count ≥250 cells/mm3 (in the absence of prior antibiotic treatment, pancreatitis, tuberculous peritonitis, or malignancy-related ascites), immediate inoculation increased the sensitivity of cultures from about 50 to 77 percent (with delayed inoculation) to 80 to 100 percent [1,7,8].

The volume of fluid cultured also has a dramatic impact on the sensitivity of ascitic fluid cultures. In one report, for example, inoculation of 10 or 20 mL of fluid into 100 mL blood culture bottles led to a much higher culture-positivity rate than a 1 mL inoculum (93 versus 53 percent) [6].

Gram stain
A few milliliters of ascitic fluid should be sent for Gram stain in a sterile urine container or red-top tube. Centrifugation of the fluid prior to performing a Gram stain is not necessary since it does not increase the yield and may actually decrease the likelihood of obtaining a positive result [6].

Fluid from the blood culture bottles can only be used for Gram stain after they have incubated for 12 to 24 hours, so sending a separate sample immediately after the paracentesis permits receiving the Gram stain results much more rapidly.

Cell count
Approximately 1 mL of fluid should be injected into a purple-top EDTA blood-drawing tube for cell count. An accurate cell count cannot be obtained if the fluid is allowed to clot or is submitted in a non-anticoagulated tube. The cell count and differential should be ordered "stat", otherwise many laboratories will prioritize the cell count below routine peripheral blood counts.

Chemistries
Several milliliters of fluid should be injected into a red-top blood-drawing tube for chemistries. Chemistries obtained should include albumin (so the serum-ascites albumin gradient can be determined), total protein concentration, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, and amylase. If the fluid is dark orange or brown, a bilirubin concentration should be obtained.

INTERPRETATION OF ASCITIC FLUID TEST RESULTS
SBP is typically diagnosed if there is an elevated ascitic fluid absolute polymorphonuclear cell (PMN, also referred to as neutrophils) count (≥250 cells/mm3), a positive ascitic fluid bacterial culture, and absence of secondary causes of peritonitis, such as bowel perforation. However, in some cases, additional tests may be needed to support the diagnosis or to differentiate SBP from secondary bacterial peritonitis.

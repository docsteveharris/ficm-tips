- illness < 6 months

## Epidemiology

- rare: est 1600 cases/yr in US
- aetiology
    + paracetamol (UK, US) (dose dependent drug reaction)
        * alcoholics
        * malnourished
        * patients on CYP450 inducers

    + HBV, HSV etc in immunocompromised
    + idiosyncratic drug reactions
    + post-hepatectomy (small for size)

        * HELLP
        * Acute fatty liver of pregnancy

### UK epidemiology

Among 1014 patients with acute liver failure referred to King's College Hospital in the United Kingdom between 1973 and 1991, 57 percent were acetaminophen-induced, and 9 percent were attributable to hepatitis B or D

## Diagnostic patterns

### Paracetamol

Very high AST/ALT (>3500)
Low bilirubin
high INR

### Ischaemic

Very very high AST/ALT (25-250xULN), high LDH

### HBV

aminotransferases 1000-2000iu/l
ALT>AST

### Wilson's disease

aminotransferase <2000 iu/l
AST>ALT
Low ALP to bilirubin ratio (<4)
Rapidly progressive AKI
Low uric acid

### Acute Fatty Liver of pregnancy / HELLP

aminotransferases<1000 iu/l
high bilirubin
low platelets

## Work-up

anti-Hepatitis A IgM
Hepatitis B surface Ag
anti-Hepatitis B core IgM
anti-Hepatitis C
Hepatitis C RNA
anti-HSV ab
anti-VZV ab
anti-Hepatitis E IgM in pregnant women and those with travel history

## Classification


## Prognostication

Spontaneous recovery is more likely with lower grades of encephalopathy [73]:

- Grade I to II – 65 to 70 percent
- Grade III – 40 to 50 percent
- Grade IV – <20 percent

MELD
King's College Criteria

## Critical care management

- Admit if at risk or significant encephalopathy (Grade 2+)
- Discuss with Kings


### Encephalopathy

- Ammonia 
    + converted to glutamine which is osmotically active
    + >100 is a risk factor for hypertension
    + 55% of patients with ammonia > 200 micromol/l will develop intracranial hypertension
    + Rx for hyperammoniaemia (rifamixin) unproven
    + Rx with lactulose in ALF may be harmful (and causes bowel distension complicating transplant)
    + LOLA doesn't work (Acharya SK, Bhatia V, Sreenivas V et al.: Gastroenterology 136:2159, 2009)

- Minimise risk of intracranial hypertension (ICH)
    - uncommon if Grade 1/2
    - 25-75% at Grade 3/4
        + track pupils
    - run Na at 150
    - hypertonic saline for Grade 3/4 encephalopathy: hypertonic saline (30%) via infusion to maintain serum sodium levels of 145-155 mmol/L - significantly slowed onset of ICH (Murphy N, Auzinger G, Bernel W et al.: Hepatology 39:464, 2004)
    - bolus hypertonic saline (200ml 3% saline for sustained increases)

- Normothermia
    + hypothermia did not work either prophylactically or in response to ICH
    + hypothermia only in refractory cases

- ICP monitoring
    + risks: 2/92 patients - haemorrhage from bolt contributed to death (Vaquero J, Fontana RJ, Larson AM et al.: Liver Transpl 11:1581, 2005), and survival not shown to be different
    + Bernal and Wendon recommend monitoring only if ICH already suspected (not prophylactically) i.e. NH3>200 or sustained >150 and age<35 and concurrent renal or CVS failure

### Renal replacement therapy

- AKI common in paracetamol toxicity
- may be used to help control ammonia load and acid-base disturbances


### N-acetyl cysteine


- AST should fall by 50%/day, continue until <500
- beneficial in non-paracetamol ALF (Lee WM, Hynan LS, Rossaro L et al.: Gastroenterology 137:856, 2009)

### Antibiotics

> In the absence of an evi- dence base to guide practice, we administer antibi- otics preemptively in patients who have coagulopa- thy and organ failure or encephalopathy and those in whom illness progression is considered likely.
-- Bernal and Wendon 2013, NEJM

- fluconazole: low index of suspicion for fungal infection

### Coagulopathy

- balanced loss of procoagulant and anticoagulant factors
- patient may be procoagulant
- functional testing ideal
- attempt to avoid correction of clotting factors

### Haemodynamics

- Consider sodium bicarbonate 1.26% as a resuscitation fluid
- Target CPP 60 mmHg
- Noradrenaline or vasopressin
- prophylactic PPI/H2-antagonists

### Nutrition

- glucose replacement if hypoglycaemic
- feed as usual (1 to 1.5g protein per kg per day) but reduce if unable to control ammonia or ICH

### Transplantation

- survival 79% at 1 year and 72% at 5 years
- deaths tend to be early in 1st 3 months and associated with infection

## Tips

- duration of NAC
- think about hepatitis serology when starting any immunosuppression
    + lamivudine
- falling phophate is a good thing (liver regeneration)
- don't track urea to monitor AKI in ALF (as production is decreased)
- correct hypokalaemia (increases renal ammonia production from glutamine)
- very high bilirubin can give false +ve paracetamol levels (so don't stop looking for other causes)

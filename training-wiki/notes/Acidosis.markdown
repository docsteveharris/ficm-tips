However, of the mathematical rules that are acceptable for clinical use, the two that are easiest to remember are:

pCO2 = HCO3 + 15
The pCO2 should approximate the decimal digits of the arterial pH (for example, if the pH is 7.25, then the pCO2 should be about 25 mmHg)
These rules work well for mild to moderately severe metabolic acidosis (HCO3 between 7 and 22 meq/L). For more severe metabolic acidosis (HCO3 less than 7 meq/L), the pCO2 should be maximally reduced to the 8 to 12 mmHg range. As an example, assume the following results are obtained in a patient with metabolic acidosis: pH = 7.30; pCO2 = 30 mmHg; HCO3 = 15 meq/L.

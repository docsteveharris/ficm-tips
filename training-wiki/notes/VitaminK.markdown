Vitamin K
=========

Clinical
--------

Symptoms — Clinical signs and symptoms of vitamin K deficiency include easy bruisability, mucosal bleeding, splinter hemorrhages, melena, hematuria, or any other manifestations of impaired coagulation. Vitamin K deficiency in an otherwise healthy adult is rare. This is largely due to the wide distribution of phylloquinone in plants, menaquinone production by gut micro-flora, and because vitamin K is easily recycled within cells (figure 2). However, an acquired deficiency can occur secondary to drugs such as antibiotics. Patients on total parenteral nutrition or those on long-term antibiotics are prone to develop vitamin K deficiency and require supplementation. Prolonged fasting or starvation also decreases vitamin K levels. Such patients are more sensitive to treatment with coumarin-based anticoagulants [11]. (See 'Daily value' below and "Beta-lactam antibiotics: Mechanisms of action and resistance and adverse effects", section on 'Hematologic reactions'.)

Laboratory evaluation — The coagulation abnormalities caused by vitamin K deficiency are manifested as prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR). When the deficiency is mild, only the PT may be prolonged, due to a predominant effect on factor VII. In severe vitamin K deficiency, both the PT and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) may be affected. Levels of PIVKA-II (Proteins induced in vitamin K absence) are more sensitive than PT in detecting vitamin K deficiency and may be helpful in monitoring patients with diseases predisposing to vitamin K deficiency. Vitamin K levels also can be measured directly but are impractical for clinical use. (See "Clinical use of coagulation tests", section on 'Causes of prolonged PT'.)

Causes — Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin, thus any cause of fat malabsorption may result in vitamin K deficiency. Fat malabsorption may be caused by disorders of bile or pancreatic secretion, or by extensive disease or resection of the intestinal mucosa. As examples, patients with the following disorders are at risk for fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies and usually require supplementation and monitoring, as discussed in the corresponding topic reviews:


■Cystic fibrosis (See "Cystic fibrosis: Nutritional issues", section on 'Vitamin K'.)
■Primary biliary cirrhosis (See "Overview of the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis", section on 'Deficiencies of fat soluble vitamins'.)
■Primary sclerosing cholangitis (See "Primary sclerosing cholangitis in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Steatorrhea and vitamin deficiency'.)
■Biliary atresia (See "Biliary atresia", section on 'Fat-soluble vitamin supplements'.)
■Familial intrahepatic cholestasis and other inherited disorders associated with cholestasis (See "Inherited disorders associated with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia".)
■Intestinal diseases associated with malabsorption, such as active celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or short bowel syndrome, may be associated with vitamin K deficiency. This is particularly true if the terminal ileum is involved because this can cause maldigestion of the fat-soluble vitamins by reducing the bile salt pool. (See "Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in adults" and "Nutrient deficiencies in inflammatory bowel disease" and "Chronic complications of the short bowel syndrome in children".)

Because the vitamin-K dependent coagulation factors are synthesized in the liver, severe parenchymal liver disease also may lead to deficiencies of these factors. In patients with severe liver disease and coagulation abnormalities, measurement of factors V and VII can help to distinguish between liver parenchymal dysfunction and vitamin K malabsorption. (See "Coagulation abnormalities in patients with liver disease".)

Antibiotics can contribute to vitamin K deficiency by affecting intestinal bacteria, and also through direct effects on vitamin K activation in the liver. Most of the ingested vitamin K is absorbed in the distal small intestine. A number of microorganisms, which colonize the colon and distal ileum, synthesize absorbable vitamin K (vitamin K2, menaquinone). Many broad-spectrum antibiotics diminish this population of bacteria, limiting menaquinone production [12]. Second and third generation antibiotics are associated with hypoprothrombinemia and have a weak coumarin-like effect in patients with low vitamin K stores [13]. They cause vitamin K deficiency by inhibiting the function of vitamin K epoxide reductase enzyme in the liver, therefore impairing the recycling of vitamin K (figure 2) [13].

Extremely high doses of vitamin E and A antagonize vitamin K [14]. Hypervitaminosis A appears to reduce absorption of vitamin K, as suggested by the observation that the parenteral infusion of vitamin A (retinoic acid) does not increase the vitamin K requirement [15]. Very high doses of vitamin E also cause vitamin K deficiency, but do not appear to affect absorption [16].

Management
----------

Dosing:
Adult Note: According to the manufacturer, SubQ is the preferred parenteral route; I.M. route should be avoided due to the risk of hematoma formation; I.V. route should be restricted for emergency use only. The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) recommends the I.V. route in patients with major bleeding secondary to use of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs).

Adequate intake (AI): Oral: Males: 120 mcg/day; Females: 90 mcg/day

Hypoprothrombinemia due to drugs (other than coumarin derivatives) or factors limiting absorption or synthesis: Oral, SubQ, I.M., I.V.: Initial: 2.5-25 mg (rarely up to 50 mg)

Vitamin K deficiency (supratherapeutic INR) secondary to VKAs (eg, warfarin) (unlabeled dose):

If INR above therapeutic range to <4.5 (no evidence of bleeding): Lower or hold next VKA dose and monitor frequently; when INR approaches desired range, resume VKA dosing with a lower dose (Patriquin, 2011).

If INR 4.5-10 (no evidence of bleeding): The 2012 ACCP guidelines recommend against routine phytonadione (aka, vitamin K) administration in this setting (Guyatt, 2012). Previously, the 2008 ACCP guidelines recommended if no risk factors for bleeding exist, to omit next 1 or 2 VKA doses, monitor INR more frequently, and resume with an appropriately adjusted VKA dose when INR in desired range; may consider administering vitamin K orally 1-2.5 mg if other risk factors for bleeding exist (Hirsh, 2008). Others have recommended consideration of vitamin K 1 mg orally or 0.5 mg I.V. (Patriquin, 2011).

If INR >10 (no evidence of bleeding): The 2012 ACCP guidelines recommend administration of oral vitamin K (dose not specified) in this setting (Guyatt, 2012). Previously, the 2008 ACCP guidelines recommended to hold warfarin, administer vitamin K orally 2.5-5 mg, expect INR to be reduced within 24-48 hours, monitor INR more frequently and give additional vitamin K at an appropriate dose if necessary; resume warfarin at an appropriately adjusted dose when INR is in desired range (Hirsh, 2008). Others have recommended consideration of vitamin K 2-2.5 mg orally or 0.5-1 mg I.V. (Patriquin, 2011).

If minor bleeding at any INR elevation: Hold warfarin, may administer vitamin K orally 2.5-5 mg, monitor INR more frequently, may repeat dose after 24 hours if INR correction incomplete; resume warfarin at an appropriately adjusted dose when INR is in desired range (Patriquin, 2011).

If major bleeding at any INR elevation: The 2012 ACCP guidelines recommend administration of four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and I.V. vitamin K 5-10 mg in this setting (Guyatt, 2012). The only available four-factor PCC in the U.S. is Kcentra. Other four-factor PCCs not available in the U.S. include Beriplex P/N, Cofact, and Octaplex. Bebulin VH and Profilnine SD do not contain adequate levels of factor VII and are considered three-factor PCCs. Previously, the 2008 ACCP guidelines recommended to hold warfarin, administer vitamin K 10 mg by slow I.V. infusion and supplement with PCC depending on the urgency of the situation; I.V. vitamin K may be repeated every 12 hours (Hirsh, 2008).

Note: Use of high doses of vitamin K (eg, 10-15 mg) may cause warfarin resistance for ≥1 week. During this period of resistance, heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) may be given until INR responds (Ansell, 2008).

Preprocedural/surgical INR normalization in patients receiving warfarin (routine use): Oral: 1-2.5 mg once administered on the day before surgery; recheck INR on day of procedure/surgery (Douketis, 2012). Others have recommended the use of vitamin K 1 mg orally for mild INR elevations (ie, INR 3.0-4.5) (Patriquin, 2011).

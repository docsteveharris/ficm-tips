# Infection control and contact isolation in the ICU

## Motivation

Critical care units run at near full occupancy, and so allocation of patients to the unit is difficult.  Full units cause delays to admission which, in turn, may lead to worse outcomes.  Not all bed spaces in a unit are suitable for all patients. Some require patients require isolation either because they might infect others, or because they are vulnerable to infections themselves. The number of rooms in an ICU suitable for isolation is even more limited, and it allocating a patient to a side room means cross-cover by nursing staff of more than one patient is often impractical. This further decreases the ability of the critical care team to respond flexibly to increased demand.

For these reasons, it is necessary to have a very clear understanding of the evidence for infection control. Inappropriately nursing an infective patient in an open ward is a risk to others. Inappropriately isolating a patient increases bed pressure.

This discussion will focus just on patients with infections that present a risk to others.

## Infection Control

Pathogens may be simply divided into four categories:

1. Those that do not represent an infection risk to others (other than through direct inoculation) e.g. Hepatitis B

2. Those where infection may be spread by direct contact

	- Colonization of any bodily site with multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA, VRE)
	- Enteric infections (C. difficile, E. coli O157:H7, viral infections (RSV, HSV, enterovirus, parainfluenza))
	- Scabies
	- Impetigo
	- Noncontained abcesses or decubitus ulcers (especially for Staphylococcus aureus and group A streptococcus)

	Contact precautions are necessary and the patients need to be isolated or lodged with others with the same infection. Health care workers entering the area need contact precautions (gown, gloves, hand-washing) whether in contact with the patient or just with material and equipment in the room.

3. Those where airborne droplet contagion is possible

	- Neisseria meningitidis
	- Haemophilus influenzae type B
	- Mycoplasma pneumoniae
	- Bordetella pertussis
	- Diphtheria
	- Pneumonic plague
	- Influenza
	- Rubella
	- Mumps
	- Adenovirus
	- Parvovirus B19
	- RSV

	Droplets are suspended airborne particles greater than 5 microns in diameter that will not usually travel more than 1 meter though 2 meters is thought possible. HCWs should wear masks within this radius, and probably up to 3 meters. The doors of the room do not to need to be closed, and for respiratory viruses that can be transmitted by contact then precautions as above should also be followed.

	Those involved with respiratory procedures that generate aerosols (induction of anaesthesia, bronchoscopy, bronchial toilet etc.) should wear a respirator, and because of droplet during the procedure then the environment will need cleaning thereafter. If possible, such procedures should be performed in Airborne Infection Isolation Rooms (AIRR) rooms.

	4. Those where airborne contagion is possible

	- Tuberculosis
	- Varicella
	- Measles
	- Smallpox
	- SARS

	Airborne spread is possible when the infective particle is smaller than 5 microns as these remain suspended in the air. These patients need to be housed in a negative pressure room with 6--12 air changes per hour, and HCWs should wear a certified respirator (HEPA (high-efficiency particulate aerator) filter) that potentially blocks more than 99% of viral particles. Although the evidence for the superiority over standard face masks is not clear[@Loeb:2009kd], there appears to be a subset of patients who are 'super-emitters' of RNA viral particles that will pass through standard surgical masks, and spread more than 3 meters.[@Bischoff:2013ch]
	Doors to the room must be closed.

The criteria for discontinuing isolation of patients is a key determinant of the strain on ICU beds, and patient safety. For droplet contagion, the advice is that isolation should continue for a minimum of 7 days, and until fever and respiratory symptoms resolve. No ICU patient is likely to be free of respiratory symptoms so practically this means until discharge from the unit. For patients who are also immunocompromised then viral shedding is likely to be prolonged.



## Notes

Duration of isolation:
- this is a key determinant of unit occupancy: to discuss

- noravirus and Sapporovirus contact isolation but some limited evidence of airborne droplet and v low inoculum required for infection (18 viruses in context of 10e10 shed per g stool). Most individuals clear virus within 2-3 days but immunocompromised may be longer

- VRE: 3 negative stool cultures each 1 week apart but as with c diff some concern about recolonisation and some conflicting recommendations suggest no point in culturing previous infected patients within a year as they tend to remain positive; active surveillance as for mrsa beneficial

- side rooms - benefits thereof

Prophylactic approaches that work

* daily chlorhexidine bathing
* bio patches
* routine rotation of catheters
* deep cleaning

PATIENT BATHING
Use of antiseptic agents for patient bathing has been demonstrated to reduce the rate of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections and the risk of colonization with drug-resistant organisms [48-53]. The greatest efficacy has been demonstrated with chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), an antiseptic agent with broad-spectrum activity against many organisms. In a large trial (more than 7000 patients) to evaluate the effect of daily bathing with chlorhexidine-impregnated washcloths (compared with use of non-impregnated washcloths) in intensive care units and bone marrow transplant units, a 28 percent reduction in the rate of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections due to gram-positive and fungal organisms was observed in the chlorhexidine bathing group (4.8 versus 6.6 cases per 1000 patient-days; p = 0.007) [48]. The effect was greater among patients with a longer length of hospital stay [51]. There was also a 23 percent reduction in the overall rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) acquisition (5.1 versus 6.6 cases per 1000 patient-days; p = 0.03). Bathing with chlorhexidine was not associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of central catheterâ€“associated bloodstream infections involving gram-negative organisms or those involving VRE or MRSA [51].

In a large trial including pediatric patients older than two months (more than 6000 patients) evaluating the effect of daily bathing with chlorhexidine-impregnated washcloths (compared with standard bathing practices), a nonsignificant reduction in the incidence of bacteremia was observed in the intention-to-treat analysis (3.5 versus 4.9 per 1000 days) [54].

Emergence of resistance to chlorhexidine is an important consideration [52,55]. In a study including two 15-bed intensive care units over a four-year period, introduction of a chlorhexidine-based surface antiseptic protocol was associated with a 70 percent reduction in MRSA transmission, although transmission of strains carrying the plasmid-born qacA/B gene (which codes for multidrug efflux pumps and can lead to chlorhexidine resistance) was not reduced [52]. Resistance to triclosan, an ingredient in some antimicrobial soaps, has also emerged among dermal, intestinal, and environmental microorganisms, including S. aureus [56,57].

Other issues related to prevention and control of infection due to drug-resistant organisms are discussed separately. (See "Prevention and control of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in adults" and "Epidemiology, prevention and control of vancomycin-resistant enterococci".)

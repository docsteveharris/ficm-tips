# Questions

What proportion of critical care pneumonia has a positive microbiological diagnosis?
- of these what proportion is bacterial
- among the non-bacterial, what proportion is viral?

What is the best method for diagnosing viral pneumonia?
What viral pneumonias respond to Rx?

# Epidemiology

## Community acquired pneumonia

- 5 cases per 1000 persons per year
- winter >> summer
- elderly
- men >> women
- black >> white
- Strep pneumonia commonest

## Virulence factors

- Chlamydophila pneumoniae produces a ciliostatic factor.
- Mycoplasma pneumoniae can shear off cilia.
- Influenza virus markedly reduces tracheal mucus velocity within hours of onset of infection and for up to 12 weeks postinfection.
- Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis produce proteases that can split secretory IgA. In addition, the pneumococcus produces other virulence factors, including: the capsule that inhibits phagocytosis, pneumolysin, a thiol-activated cytolysin that interacts with cholesterol in host cell membranes, neuraminidase, and hyaluronidase.
- Mycobacterium spp, Nocardia spp, and Legionella spp are resistant to the microbicidal activity of phagocytes.

## Iatrogenic related risk factors

- immunosuppression
- nosocomial pneumonia incidence increases with acid suppression (PPI, ranitidine etc)
- antipsychotics: dose dependent increase
- ACEi ?decr incidence but only in observational not randomised studies therefore reporting bias?
- inhaled steroids - increased risk

## Microbiology

- many culture negative cases are caused by pneumococcus?
	- sputum cultures -ve in 50% patients with pneumococcal bacteraemia
	- 50% of culture negative cases respond to penicillin
	- using more invasive diagnostic techniques yields higher rates of strep pneumoniae

# Diagnosis

- purulent sputum in an intubated patient may still just indicate tracheobronchitis
- fastidious organisms may not survive prolonged transport

- Expectorated sputum (but often is an upper not lower respiratory tract specimen); but recommended for all critically ill patients (but often not for outpatient managed cases)
	- reject samples > squamous epithelial cells (SEC) per low power field (LPC)
	- sample should ideally contain polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN)
	- proceed to gram stain
	- tips
		- sample before antibiotics
		- rinse mouth first
- Bronchoscopy washings, variable utility,
	- Mini-BAL: advance catheter until obstruction met, flush saline, suction
	- Bronchoscopic washings may provide better samples, and lead to more rapid de-escalation of broad spectrum antibiotics
	- can do a cell count ?exclude pneumonia if neutrophils <50% of total nucleated cells

- notes:
	- Spanish observational study, 12 years of consecutive admissions to hospital in Barcelona
	- excluded immunocompromised and health care associated
	- 3524 patients, micro diagnosis in 1463 (42%), of these ...
	- 17% Strep pneumoniae
	- 4.% respiratory virus
	- 6% polymicrobial
	- No other single organism accounted for >2% individually

Fluids may be withheld in patients with significant pulmonary edema due to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or heart failure (HF). In patients with a pulmonary artery catheter, pulmonary capillary wedge pressures (PCWP) of 18 to 24 mmHg are recommended for cardiogenic shock [7], and 12 to 14 mmHg for septic or hypovolemic shock [8].

Hemodynamic effects
MAP is influenced by systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and cardiac output (CO). In situations such as cardiogenic shock, elevating SVR increases afterload and the work of an already failing heart, thus potentially lowering CO. Some authors recommend keeping the SVR approximately 700 to 1000 dynes x sec/cm5 to avoid excessive afterload and to minimize complications from profound vasoconstriction (calculator 1) [11]. However, there is no consensus regarding an ideal target cardiac index (CI). Studies that have attempted to maintain a supraphysiologic CI of >4.0 to 4.5 L/minute per m2 have not shown consistent benefit [12,13]. (See "Oxygen delivery and consumption".)

Metadata: 

- 2% healthy adults are carriers but this rises to 25-50% of hospitalised patients
- contact isolation for the duration of the diarrhoea although there is some suggestion that skin carriage may persist thereafter and isolation should continue until discharge.
- spores persist months - best killed with hypochlorite not bleach
increased risk of infection for subsequent occupier of room where prev c diff (hence raised the question of using same room for immunocompromised)

DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis of C. difficile infection requires the presence of moderate to severe diarrhea or ileus, and either [41-45]:

A stool test positive for C. difficile toxins or toxigenic C. difficile
Endoscopic or histologic findings of pseudomembranous colitis
Diagnostic stool evaluation for the presence of C. difficile toxins should be pursued in the setting of clinically significant diarrhea (usually defined as three or more loose stools per day for at least two days); suspicion is warranted if many stools (10 to 15) occur with fever or nocturnal diarrhea even if only one day in duration.

In general, only loose, watery, or semi-formed stool should be tested for C. difficile [46-50]. Diagnosis via swab may be warranted for patients with suspected C. difficile infection and ileus [46,47,51,52]. C. difficile toxin degrades at room temperature and may be undetectable within two hours after collection [45]; specimens should be kept at 4ºC if delay is anticipated. A suspected outbreak should prompt freezing of stool samples for later investigation.

Laboratory diagnosis
Laboratory diagnosis of C. difficile infection requires demonstration of C. difficile toxin(s) or detection of toxigenic C. difficile organism(s) [41]. A number of tests are available, including [45,47,53]:

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for C. difficile glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)
Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for C. difficile toxins A and B
Cell culture cytotoxicity assay
Selective anaerobic culture
These tests are discussed in further detail below.

PCR testing — Real-time PCR tests that detect toxin A and B genes are highly sensitive and specific [54-57]. The sensitivity of PCR is greater than enzyme immunoassay and comparable to cytotoxicity assay [47,58-62]. In addition, PCR results can be available within as little as one hour. Given its high sensitivity and potential for false positive results, some favor use of PCR in an algorithm together with other assays such as EIA for GHD and EIA for toxins A and B. (See 'Clinical approach' below.)
EIA for C. difficile GDH — GDH antigen is an essential enzyme produced constitutively by all C. difficile isolates; its detection cannot distinguish between toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains [63-65]. Therefore, testing for GDH antigen is useful as an initial screening step in a multistep approach, which also consists of subsequent testing with more specific assays such as PCR on specimens that are GDH antigen positive [47,66]. GDH antigen testing is highly sensitive, and results are available in less than one hour.
EIA for C. difficile toxins A and B — Most C. difficile strains produce both toxins A and B, although some strains produce toxin A or B only [67-71]. The sensitivity of EIA for toxins A and B is about 75 percent; the specificity is high (up to 99 percent) [47,72,73]. There is a relatively high false negative rate since 100 to 1000 pg of toxin must be present for the test to be positive [33]. A number of inexpensive assays are commercially available, and test results are available within hours [47].
If the initial EIA test is negative, the value of repeating the test is limited and repeat testing is generally discouraged [47,74-76]. Three studies found fewer than 10 percent more cases by repeated testing [77-79], while two others found 19 percent and 20 percent more cases with one or two further tests [74,80].

Cell culture cytotoxicity assay — The cell culture cytotoxicity assay is the ‘gold standard’ test for diagnosis of C. difficile, and is the standard against which other tests should be compared [81,82]. It performed by adding a prepared stool sample (diluted, buffered, and filtered) to a monolayer of cultured cells [83]. If C. difficile toxin is present, it exerts a cytopathic effect characterized by rounding of fibroblasts in tissue culture (figure 2). The cytotoxicity assay is more sensitive than enzyme immunoassays, but is labor intensive and takes approximately two days [41,45,84].
Selective anaerobic culture — Culture on selective medium with toxin testing of isolated C. difficile is the most sensitive diagnostic method, although it cannot distinguish toxin-producing strains from non-toxin producing strains [82]. Prior treatment with heat or alcohol to select spores is sometimes used to improve yield. Culture is useful for epidemiologic studies, but is generally too slow and labor-intensive for clinical use [72].
A number of multistep algorithms have been developed in an attempt to improve the accuracy of diagnostic testing for C. difficile infection [47,63-66,85].

Clinical approach
We favor use of PCR for diagnosis of C. difficile, either alone or as part of an algorithm (including initial EIA screening for GDH, with or without EIA screening for toxins A and B) [86,87]. The high sensitivity and specificity of PCR, together with its rapid turn-around time, allow prompt isolation and treatment of patients with C. difficile infection, likely reducing opportunity for nosocomial spread and improving patient outcomes. An algorithmic approach may be less expensive but take slightly longer and may have reduced sensitivity compared with PCR alone [87].

In a study comparing the Cepheid Xpert C. difficile PCR assay with cell culture cytotoxicity assay for diagnosis of CDAD, the sensitivity and specificity of the Cepheid assay were 97 and 93 percent, respectively [88]. Using the PCR ribotyping as a reference for the hypervirulent 027 strain, the sensitivity and specificity were 100 and 98.1 percent, respectively. A previous study compared PCR and EIA techniques with anaerobic culture (the "most sensitive") in 618 stool samples; sensitivity and specificity were better for PCR than EIA (93 and 97 percent versus 73 and 97 percent, respectively) [89]. PCR results may be falsely negative if stool specimen collection is delayed and the patient treated empirically for suspected C. difficile infection [90].

The diagnostic approach for suspected recurrent C. difficile is the same as the approach for initial infection. There is no clinical role for laboratory diagnosis among asymptomatic patients or among patients on treatment for acute disease, whose stool assays may remain positive during or after clinical recovery.

The peak systolic pressure in the PA occurs just prior to the electrocardiographic T wave, whereas the peak V wave of a PCWP tracing occurs after the electrocardiographic T wave.

Final position
The final position of the catheter within the PA must be such that a PCWP tracing is obtained whenever 75 to 100 percent of the 1.5 mL maximum volume of the balloon is insufflated (figure 3).

If less than 1 mL is required to obtain a PCWP tracing, the tip of the catheter is probably in the distal PA and further inflation may lead to vessel rupture. In this situation, the catheter should be withdrawn incrementally, until the optimal position is found.
If maximal balloon inflation fails to result in a PCWP tracing, or does so only after a 2 to 3 second delay, the catheter is probably too proximal. This means that it could slip back into the RV, increasing the risk of arrhythmia and intracardiac damage. In this situation, the catheter should be advanced in small increments, until the optimal position is located.


Finally, a chest radiograph should be obtained to confirm the position of the catheter. The tip of the catheter should be no more than 3 to 5 cm from the midline. Daily chest radiographs are often obtained to monitor for migration of the catheter tip and other complications associated with prolonged use.

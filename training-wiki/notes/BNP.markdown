The data supporting the diagnostic accuracy of natriuretic peptides are largely derived from emergency department patients. The role of BNP and NT-proBNP in other settings, in particular the intensive care unit (ICU), is less well established.

An observational series from a single center suggests that in an ICU setting, patients with a diagnosis of sepsis are as likely to have elevated BNP and NT-proBNP levels as patients with decompensated HF [15]. Among 249 consecutive patients, 24 were diagnosed with sepsis and 51 with decompensated HF. The following findings were noted:

●BNP and NT-proBNP levels were similar in both groups (572 versus 581 ng/L, and 6526 versus 4300 ng/L for sepsis and HF patients, respectively).
●Patients with decompensated HF had a significantly higher mean pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressure (22 versus 16 mmHg) and a lower mean cardiac index (2.2 versus 4.6 L/min per m2).
Thus, in a heterogeneous population of critically ill patients, levels of natriuretic peptides were similar in patients with sepsis and those with decompensated HF.

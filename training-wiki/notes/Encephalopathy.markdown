A generally accepted nomenclature for hepatic encephalopathy was proposed by the World Organization of Gastroenterology (OMGE) based on a consensus statement developed by a group of experts meeting at the 11th World Congress of Gastroenterology in Vienna in 1998 (table 1) [14]. It takes into account both the type of hepatic abnormality and the duration/characteristics of the neurologic manifestations.

A classification scheme based on this nomenclature has been proposed (table 2) [14,15]:

Type A: hepatic encephalopathy occurring in the setting of acute liver failure
Type B: hepatic encephalopathy occurring in the setting of portal-systemic bypass with no intrinsic hepatocellular disease
Type C: hepatic encephalopathy occurring in the setting of cirrhosis with portal hypertension or systemic shunting
Hepatic encephalopathy is then subcategorized as:

Episodic
Recurrent (bouts of hepatic encephalopathy that occur within a time interval of six months or less)
Persistent (a pattern of behavioral alterations that are always present interspersed with episodes of overt hepatic encephalopathy)
Minimal
Episodic hepatic encephalopathy is further subdivided based on whether it was precipitated or developed spontaneously. Persistent hepatic encephalopathy is subdivided based on its severity (mild, severe, or treatment-dependent).

The severity of hepatic encephalopathy traditionally has been graded from I to IV based on the clinical manifestations (table 3 and figure 1) (see 'Clinical manifestations' below):

Grade I: Changes in behavior, mild confusion, slurred speech, disordered sleep
Grade II: Lethargy, moderate confusion
Grade III: Marked confusion (stupor), incoherent speech, sleeping but arousable
Grade IV: Coma, unresponsive to pain
Patients with grade I encephalopathy may have mild asterixis, whereas pronounced asterixis is seen in patients with grade II or III encephalopathy [16]. Asterixis is typically absent in patients with grade IV encephalopathy, who instead may demonstrate decorticate or decerebrate posturing.

However, this grading system does not take into account patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy who may have very subtle signs and symptoms that may only be detected using specialized psychometric tests [4-6]. In addition, it may be difficult to differentiate mild (grade I) hepatic encephalopathy from minimal hepatic encephalopathy. The International Society for Hepatic Encephalopathy and Nitrogen Metabolism consensus suggests that the term "covert hepatic encephalopathy" be used for both minimal and mild (grade I) hepatic encephalopathy, and that the term "overt hepatic encephalopathy" be used for more severe hepatic encephalopathy (grades II-IV) [17]. (See 'Psychometric tests' below.)

Metadata: 

- Phenethylamine â€¦ the basic unit of all monoamines (tyramine, dopamine, adrenaline, noradrenaline etc); found in chocolate!!!


## Notes

### Synthesis
	1. Substrate is Tyrosine (R = methyl-Phenol) (some formed fr Phenylalanine via phenylalanine hydroxylase; R = methyl-Benzene)
	2. Tyrosine Hydroxylase produces DOPA (Dihydroxyphenylalanine); Rate controlling step under -ve fb by dopamine and noradrenaline
	3. DOPA decarboxylase: converts DOPA to Dopamine
	4. Dopamine Beta-Hydroxylase: converts Dopamine to Noradrenaline
	5. PNMT (Phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferasse): converts NAd to Adrenaline; PNMT only present in adrenal medulla and some other specialised neurones
### Storage
	- Stored in vesicles with chromagranin A or B, and sometimes neuropeptide Y
	- Storage in vesicles by active transport which is inhibited by reserpine
	- Exocytosis also releases into circulation and synapse ATP, chromogranin A, and dopamine beta-hydroxylase
	- Circulating Chromogranin A can be used as a measure of sympathetic activity
### Catabolism
	- Oxidation via MAO or methylation (of 3-hydroxy grp on catechol ring) by COMT (catechol-o-methyl transferase)
	- MAO: found on outer surface of mitochondria; wide distribution esp in nerve endings
	- COMT: not found in nerve endings but wide distribution in liver, kidney, and smooth muscle

### Old Notes
	- synthesised fr tyrosine which is synthesised from dietary phenylalanine; phenylotonuric patients who phenylalanine hydroxylase depend on dietary tyrosine 
	- vesicle storage: complicated structures with 2 types of protein: >channels/pumps etc: for uptake and storage into vesicle >vesicle movement: direct mov't, docking and endocytosis/exocytosis with cell membrane; exocytosis - Ca2+ dependednt conserved mechn, complicated, fast; independent of cell organelles
	- Inactivation: uptake 1 (neuronal tissue) and 2 (non-neuronal tissue ie lung): uptake 1 presynaptic vacuolar pump proton (cotransporter) up electrochemical gradient; Remainder deaminated by MAO; reuptake physiologically must be fast to enable rapid on/off effect and fine control; fastest in heart - slower in vascular system 
	- Lung important in deactivation (but not for dopamine or adrenaline)

Drugs indirectly affecting adrenergic pharmacology
	- Ephedrine / Bretylium: displace NAd fr vesicles
	- Reserpine: blocks vesicle re-uptake and hence incr local NT (neurotransmitter) levels; 
	- Guanethidine: prevents NAd release from nerve terminals
	- Cocaine: blocks re-uptake (as do TCA's)
	- Tyramine: enters via uptake 1; displaces NAd forms a false transmitter hence anti-hypertensive; in large quantities though displaces NAd rapidly and hypertensive crisis; dietary tyramine normally inactivated by gut MAO

- in severely unwell, some evidence for combination therapy

- title: Combination Antibiotic Therapy Lowers Mortality among Severely Ill Patients with Pneumococcal Bacteremia
- notes:
	- 844 patients, 21 hospitals, 10 countries
	- consecutive admissions with pneumococcal pneumonia 1998--2000
	- blood culture positive for pneumococcus
	- 70% 'sensitive' and 10% 'high level resistance'
	- among critically ill patients, combination therapy very markedly reduced mortality (50>>20%)
	- typical combination therapy = beta-lactam + macrolide | vancomycin

- Nasopharyngeal colonization - Pneumococci are acquired by aerosol inhalation, leading to colonization of the nasopharynx. Colonization is present in 40 to 50 percent of healthy adults and persists for four to six weeks. Carriage may involve more than one serotype at a time. Disease occurs most frequently upon acquisition of a serotype different from those with which an individual may be colonized. Pneumococcal carriage is more common in smokers than nonsmokers.
-  Invasive disease, defined by the isolation of S. pneumoniae from a normally sterile site (eg, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, but not sputum), most commonly occurs upon acquisition of a new serotype, typically after an incubation period of one to three days.

- Pneumococcal urinary antigen - The need for improved speed and accuracy in the diagnosis of pneumonia has led to the development of a urinary assay for pneumococcal cell wall components [70]. The reported sensitivity of the Binax NOW urinary assay ranges from 70 to 90 percent, with a specificity of 80 to 100 percent in adults with pneumonia [71,72]. The specificity is lower in the setting of nasopharyngeal carriage without infection [71], and appears to be increased in patients with bacteremia or severe infection [72]. In a prospective study that included 171 adults hospitalized with CAP caused by S. pneumoniae, the majority of whom did not have S. pneumoniae isolated from blood cultures, the sensitivity of the pneumococcal urinary antigen was 71 percent and the specificity was 96 percent [73]. Among patients with a definite diagnosis of pneumococcal CAP, the sensitivity of urinary antigen testing was 78 percent compared with 57 percent in those with a probable diagnosis. A definite diagnosis was defined as S. pneumoniae isolated from a blood culture or pleural fluid culture, or detected by PCR from pleural fluid, whereas a probable diagnosis required S. pneumoniae to be the predominant organism in a good quality sputum sample with an accompanying positive Gram stain. Pneumococcal CAP was diagnosed exclusively by the urinary antigen test in 75 cases (44 percent). The results of the urinary antigen test led clinicians to reduce the spectrum of antibiotics in 41 of 474 patients with CAP (9 percent). This study suggests that although the sensitivity of the pneumococcal urinary antigen test is lower in patients who are not bacteremic, the presence of a positive urinary antigen test in a non-bacteremic patient can be helpful for tailoring therapy.

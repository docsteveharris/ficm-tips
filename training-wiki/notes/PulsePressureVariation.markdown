OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the respiratory changes in arterial pulse (DeltaPP) and in systolic pressure (DeltaSP) could predict fluid responsiveness in spontaneously breathing (SB) patients. Because changes in intrathoracic pressure during spontaneous breathing (SB) might be insufficient to modify loading conditions of the ventricles, performances of indicators were also assessed during a forced respiratory maneuver.
DESIGN: Prospective interventional study.
SETTING: A 34-bed university hospital medico-surgical ICU.
PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two SB patients with clinical signs of hemodynamic instability.
INTERVENTION: A 500-ml volume expansion (VE).
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Cardiac index, assessed using transthoracic echocardiography, increased by at least 15% after VE in 19 patients (responders). At baseline, only dynamic indicators were higher in responders than in nonresponders (13+/-5% vs. 7+/-3%, p=0.003 for DeltaPP and 10+/-4% vs. 6+/-2%, p=0.002 for DeltaSP). Moreover, they significantly decreased after VE (11+/-5% to 6+/-4%, p<0.001 for DeltaPP and 8+/-4% to 6+/-3%, p<0.001 for DeltaSP). DeltaPP and DeltaSP areas under the ROC curve were high (0.81+/-0.08 and 0.82+/-0.08; p=0.888, respectively). A DeltaPP>or=12% predicted fluid responsiveness with high specificity (92%) but poor sensitivity (63%). The forced respiratory maneuver reproducing a dyspneic state decreased the predictive power.
CONCLUSIONS: Due to their lack of sensitivity and their dependence to respiratory status, DeltaPP and DeltaSP are clearly less reliable to predict fluid responsiveness during SB than in mechanically ventilated patients. However, when their baseline value is high without acute right ventricular dysfunction in a participating patient, a positive response to fluid is likely.

OBJECTIVE: Passive leg raising (PLR) represents a "self-volume challenge" that could predict fluid response and might be useful when the respiratory variation of stroke volume cannot be used for that purpose. We hypothesized that the hemodynamic response to PLR predicts fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients.
DESIGN: Prospective study.
SETTING: Medical intensive care unit of a university hospital.
PATIENTS: We investigated 71 mechanically ventilated patients considered for volume expansion. Thirty-one patients had spontaneous breathing activity and/or arrhythmias.
INTERVENTIONS: We assessed hemodynamic status at baseline, after PLR, and after volume expansion (500 mL NaCl 0.9% infusion over 10 mins).
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We recorded aortic blood flow using esophageal Doppler and arterial pulse pressure. We calculated the respiratory variation of pulse pressure in patients without arrhythmias. In 37 patients (responders), aortic blood flow increased by>or =15% after fluid infusion. A PLR increase of aortic blood flow>or =10% predicted fluid responsiveness with a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 94%. A PLR increase of pulse pressure>or =12% predicted volume responsiveness with significantly lower sensitivity (60%) and specificity (85%). In 30 patients without arrhythmias or spontaneous breathing, a respiratory variation in pulse pressure>or =12% was of similar predictive value as was PLR increases in aortic blood flow (sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 93%). In patients with spontaneous breathing activity, the specificity of respiratory variations in pulse pressure was poor (46%).
CONCLUSIONS: The changes in aortic blood flow induced by PLR predict preload responsiveness in ventilated patients, whereas with arrhythmias and spontaneous breathing activity, respiratory variations of arterial pulse pressure poorly predict preload responsiveness.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Predicting volume responsiveness in patients with spontaneous breathing activity is a difficult challenge in the emergency room as well as in the intensive care unit because heart-lung interactions indices cannot be reliably used as they can be in mechanically ventilated patients fully adapted to their ventilator. The aim of this review is to summarize the different tools that have been proposed to predict the hemodynamic response to fluid infusion in the presence of spontaneous breathing activity.
RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical studies recently demonstrated that neither indicators of cardiac preload (filling pressures and end-diastolic ventricular dimensions) nor arterial pulse pressure respiratory variation was an accurate predictor of volume responsiveness in patients with spontaneous breathing activity with or without mechanical support. In contrast, performing a passive leg-raising test has been proved as valuable for this purpose.
SUMMARY: The passive leg-raising test is the only method that has been repeatedly shown to be reliable for predicting volume responsiveness in patients who experience spontaneous breathing. The appropriate utilization of this test requires a real-time assessment of its effects on systemic blood flow.

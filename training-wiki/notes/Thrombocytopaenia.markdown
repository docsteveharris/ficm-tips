## Principles
- bleeding
	- ITP:
		-  bleeding NB haematuria correlates with risk of intracerebral bleeding in ITP
		- studies show that surgical bleeding generally only a problem if plts <60x10^9^, spontaneous bleeding requiring intervention <12, life threatening bleeding <6
		- However, in ITP, reduced platelet half life means plts are younger and better at haemostasis, so a pt with other coagulation abnormalities eg on aspirin, liver failure, DIC, may bleed at higher counts


## Causes of thrombocytopaenia in critical care:

- drug induced (HIT, heparin, quinine, quinidine, valproic acid, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors can cause both a pseudothrombocytopaenia and a rapid onset immune-thrombocytopaenia) (accelerated plt destruction, bone marrow suppression e.g. linezolid)
- viral infection (HIV, Hep C) (bone marrow suppression, immune)
- chemotherapy/radiotherapy (bone marrow suppression)
- bone marrow failure syndrome (bone marrow suppression)
- alcohol  (bone marrow suppression, splenic sequestration)
- sepsis, cardiopulomary bypass or resus, ARDS
- microangiopathy-associated (TTP-HUS, HELLP, DIC) (consumption)
- haemofiltration (consumption), generally need some other cause too to be clinically apparent
- anti-phospholipid syndrome, SLE (immune)
- immune thrombocytopaenia
- dilutional (massive blood loss with massive transfusion)
- splenomegaly -> splenic sequestration NB may have normal total platelet count but not in peripheral circulation)

## Management

### Non-transfusion related

- review drugs - eliminate as cause - if HIT is likely, then precludes use of heparin in the medium term
- review other cytopaenias, points to bone marrow suppression, treat vit B12/folate deficiency
- autoimmune screen and management
- screen common viral infections (HIV, viral hepatitis) and treat as necessary
screen general coagulation defect - low fibrinogen, prolonged PT (more sens than) APTT suggests DIC/ hepatic failure
- may warrant bone marrow if the above does not suggest a more common cause, or if exclusion fails to result in improved platelet count

## Platelet transfusion

- generally reserved for those who have signs of bleeding, or who are high risk of bleeding
- BCSH guidelines 2003
	- suggest 10x10^9/l is a threshold for those without high risk including sepsis, or other haemostatic abnys
	- 20x10^9 is generally used for those who are septic but not otherwise bleeding/high risk
	- to cover interventions
		- LP, liver biopsy, insertion of lines - raise to 50
		- brain/eye surgery raise to 100 (BCSH guidelines)
	- no role for routine prophylaxis pre bypass
	- no routine role in DIC/HIT/TTP unless life-threatening bleeding
	- in massive transfusion - BCSH guidelines suggest keep plt count >50 (unless major or CNS trauma) and that this threshold is likely to be passed after replacement of 2 bld vols
- In ITP, can give plts to cover procedures or bleeding, but are often refractory without concurrent treatment of ITP e.g. steroids, IvIg


## Platelet dose

- platelets must be kept at room temperature (5 days max, but still increased risk of infection) because refrigeration decreases the life of platelets after transfusion (because vWF complexes when cold which then binds to macrophages which consume platelets)
- Dose - A standard dose of platelets for prophylactic therapy in adults is approximately one random donor unit per 10 kg of body weight, which translates to four to six units of pooled platelets or one apheresis unit, both providing approximately 3 to 4 x 1011 platelets [2]. A standard pediatric dose is 5 to 10 mL/kg. For prophylactic transfusion there is generally no reason to transfuse platelets more often than once a day. This platelet dosing is expected to raise the platelet count by approximately 30,000/microL within 10 minutes of the infusion. (See 'Platelet count increment' below.)
- pooled versus apheresis platelets (single donor, possible to HLA match, reduced risk of infection)
- leukoreduction: reduces white cell exposure
- irradiated platelets: to reduce the risk of GvHD since platelets are non-nucleated only the leucocytes are damaged
- CMV status when transfusing into CMV -ve recipients who are immunosuppressed (although leucodepletion is considered to have the same effect)



## Management of platelet refractoriness

- can't diagnose on a single occasion, has to be >1 episodes of lower than expected platelet increment
- make sure you are giving a therapeutic dose - one adult pool should increase platelet count by 20x10^9 but this is dependent on estimated blood vol
- max increment should be measured at 10-60 mins post infusion, no later
- treat underlying sepsis, use of prostacyclin for haemofiltration etc
- consider sending HLA antibodies if patient has been exposed to multiple platelet pools,  is a female with a history of pregnancy and requested HLA matched platelets once this screen has been sent. A screen for allo-immune HPA antibodies (human platelet antigens) can also be sent and matched for, as well as ABO matched platelets

- notes:
	- RCT, 391 AML and bone marrow transplant patients
	- trigger of 10 (prophylaxis) vs only with bleeding (reactive)
	- reactive meant transfusuon when WHO bleeding scale >= 2 (i.e. any unexplained bleeding esp if transfusion required (which was Grade 3))
	- more bleeding in the reactive group, more CNS bleeds, no difference in survival

	- RCT, 600 bone marrow transplant patients

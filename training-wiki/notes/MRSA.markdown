Title: MRSA
Tags: clinical, pathology

- MRSA
- depends on efficacy of decolonisation and who is contaminated
	- HCW
	- Patient:
		- Define purpose: to reduce risk of infection then prob effective (see data on daily chlorhexidine baths etc) but for infection control then efficacy harder to demonstrate
		- Not consistently effective: Loeb MB, Main C, Eady A, Walker-Dilks C. Antimicrobial drugs for treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization. Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2003; :CD003340.
		- Not durable so 50% recolonised within 6 months - this includes HCWs: hence why re-screening prev infection is important and should assume prev infection is risk factor for new
		- routine screening post decolonisation not recommended? so assume decolonisation effective
	-  topical mupopiricin to nares but 25% resistance in US already and chlorhexidine baths

- ref: [@Huang:2013gk]
- title: Targeted versus universal decolonization to prevent ICU infection
- notes:
	- 3 arm cluster randomised trial 43 hospitals
	- Group 1: MRSA screening and isolation
	- Group 2: MRSA screening and isolation plus targeted decontamination
	- Group 3: Universal decontamination
	- fewer MRSA and other blood stream infections in Grp 3
	- universal decontamination used chlorhexidine
	- significant risk of mupirocin resistance

- title: Effect of daily chlorhexidine bathing on hospital-acquired infection
- notes: 
	- cluster randomised controlled trial
	- 9 adult ICUs and bone marrow transplant units
	- 2% CHG impregnated cloths for daily patient bathing vs placebo cloths
	- MRSA and VRE infection markedly reduced in intervention arm including central line associated BSI
	- similar to another study in 10 paediatric ICUs

- title: Curbing Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus in 38 French Hospitals Through a 15-Year Institutional Control Program
- notes: 
	- French program report
	- alcohol based hand gel most important intervention
	- overall program reduced MRSA infection by 50%

- title: Isolation of patients in single rooms or cohorts to reduce spread of MRSA in intensive-care units: prospective two-centre study 
- notes:
	- isolating MRSA positive patients (into a side room or cohorted bay) does not affect transmission of MRSA

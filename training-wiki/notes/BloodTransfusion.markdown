What is the minimum Hb necessary? 
- Heart does not become ischaemia/anaerobic until Hb<3.5 assuming normal coronaries and perfusion pressures/work (i.e. can bleed fit and healthy down to Hb 3.5.  
- But there are negative effects at low Hb: i.e. Patients with CCF "clinically" better with Hb>10; Hip fracture patients walk further with higher Hb; Elite athletes (aerobic) perform better with higher Hct.  DO2 is clearly rate limiting in certain situations, and a higher Hb is desirable if not essential.
- Methods to raise/preserve Hb: 
    - ICU (Webb blood sampling, haemolysis, haemorrhage etc: average loss per admission 2-3 units); TNFÎ± switches off bone marrow; 
    - EPO in ICU: No RCT to demonstrate benefit and dose ranging study unable to demonstrate difference cf placebo (PMID 16607233);

- Blood transfusion risks (standard incompatibility etc) and immunosuppression: 
- Blood conservation: Pre-op: micronutrient supplementation, autologous donation (within 4 weeks (blood shelf life) with/without EPO cover); Anticoagulant management: Intraop: Acute normovolaemic or Hypervolaemic Haemodilution; Cell Saver; Regional anaesthesia, Hypotensive, decrease venous pressure (PEEP, positioning), Low CO2, Surgical technique; Post-op: drains and cell salvage; Oxygen delivery (i.e. ICU, EPO, Intubation - minimise VO2 etc); Anticoagulants: DDAVP, Aprotinin, Transexamic acid
Preop Autologous Blood Donation (PABD): Need Hb>11 (men) and >13 (women); good safety record from USA; Not recommended for Primary Hip and Knee when Hb>14.4 (?b/c unnecessary)
- Erythropoeitin: Patients >70yrs with presenting Hb <13 needing major elective surgery ... but expensive, requires Fe/Folate supplements, Risks incl (Seizures, Thrombosis, Hypertension)
- Acute Normovolaemic Haemodilution: 1000-1500ml venesection at the start of surgery and replaced with crystalloid/colloid; blood stored at room temperature - and then returned to the patient at the end of surgery
- Blood Salvage Technology: Washing, Concentration impt b/c otherwise shed blood is of low Hct and low in clotting factors and re-transfusion induces coagulopathy and increases transfusion requirements(!); Haematinics Cell Saver 5 demonstrated to remove all protein products from retrieved blood hence safe in obstetrics (else risk of iatrogenic amniotic fluid embolism)
- Preop hypervolaemic haemodilution: give 1.5l gelofusin in average adult will decr Hct from 40% to 30% therefore reduce red cell loss by 100ml per litre blood lost which is equivalent to saving 1/2 unit transfusion per litre blood loss

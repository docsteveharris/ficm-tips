## Principles

- Liver failure see high NH3 levels - acts as resp stimulant hence produce resp alkalosis

## Complications

- Bleeding (Factor V discriminates Vit K fr Liver disease)
- Encephalopathy Grade 3/4 have GCS<8 and need intubating: Rx as raised ICP; Associated as mode of death
- Shunts: Splanchnic (hence hepatorenal) & Pulmonary (VQ mismatch)
- Ascites
- Renal Failure: Urinary Na<10 and U:P Creat >1 ... ie. Acute renal success 2ndry to splanchnic vasodilation
- Rx: midodrine (alpha1-agonist) & octeotride, terlipressin, albumin
- ARF in paracetamol overdose different and does not have the same terrible prognosis
- Impaired immunity
- Decreased complement synthesis therefore poor opsonisation of bacteria
- Kuppfler cells - poor endotoxin clearance
- Staph , E coli; often without fever/leucocytosis
- Intubation for CO2 control (ICP)/ airway protection more commonly than for hypoxia

## Acute Liver Failure Definition
- It is reversible in some patients
- It develops rapidly
- It develops in those with no pre-exisiting liver disease
- It is characteristed by encephalopathy

- King's (time based classification) - important prognostically because subacute (1-6months) has worst prognosis; Acute Liver Failure: Classified by rate of onset; Hyperacute <7d, Acute 7-28d, Subacute 1-6months: Hyperacute has best long term prognosis
- Hepatitis B: 3% go on to hepatocellular ca, Hep C ~75%
- Perioperative Management
- High mortality in acute failure/decompensation; postpone until normalised if possible (minimum 30d after normal LFTs, 3 months after hepatitis - or if urgent liver biopsy to check)
- Mayo Clinic 10yr anaesthesia in cirrhosis: ~10% peri-op mortality & 30% complications (pneumonia) [PMID 9915311]
- Investigations (LFTs)
- PaO2<8 should be seen as contra-indication
- Hepatic Blood Flow is reduced by most drugs used in anaesthesia (except isoflurane - may incr)
- Safe: Lorazepam / Propofol / Thio / Etomidate / Iso / N2O / Des / Sevo / Atrac / Remi / Paracetamol
- Avoid: NSAIDs (renal dependent on prostaglandins)
- CO2: Respiratory alkalosis common: Rx like raised ICP both for encephalopathy & b/c hypercarbia decr splanchnic perfusion via SNS
- Nutrition critical


## Postop Liver Dysfunction

- Wide differential: Classify Pre/Intra/Post
- Pre: Haemolysis (Transfusion related, Bypass etc), Gilbert's, Drugs & G6PD
- Intra: Ischaemia, Toxic (Halothane, Antibiotics, NSAIDs etc)
- Post: Intra-hepatic (Drug cholestasis: cephalosporins, erythromycin, clavulinic acid, carbamezipine, Infection), Extra-hepatic (ie stones, ligated CBD post Lap chole)

## Pharmacokinetics

- Decr 1st pass metabolism
- Prolonged metabolism
- Prolonged excretion of high MW drugs
- Decr protein binding
- Incr Vd (Na/Water retention)
- Pharmacodynamics
- Incr susceptibility to sedatives

## Fluid Resus

- Chronic: avoid Na overload
- Acute: avoid hyponatraemia, use N/Saline etc esp wrt to incr ICP (aim Na 145-150)
- Liver failure see high NH3 levels - acts as resp stimulant hence produce resp alkalosis

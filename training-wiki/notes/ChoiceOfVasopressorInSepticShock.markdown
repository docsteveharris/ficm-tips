Numerous trials have compared one vasopressor to another in septic shock. Most of the comparisons have found no difference in mortality, length of stay in the ICU, or length of stay in the hospital [51]. These trials included norepinephrine versus phenylephrine [52], norepinephrine versus vasopressin [53-55], norepinephrine versus terlipressin [35,56], norepinephrine versus epinephrine [57], and vasopressin versus terlipressin [58].

In contrast, a meta-analysis of six randomized trials (1408 patients) found increased mortality among patients who received dopamine during septic shock compared to those who received norepinephrine [11,28,48,59-62]. Patients who received dopamine had a higher 28-day mortality rate than patients who received norepinephrine (54 versus 49 percent, relative risk 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.20). Although the causes of death in the two groups were not compared, arrhythmic events were two times more common with dopamine than norepinephrine. These findings were supported by another meta-analysis [63].

Based on these data, it seems reasonable to choose a vasopressor on the basis of whether the patient has hyperdynamic or hypodynamic shock:

Hyperdynamic septic shock is characterized by a low systemic vascular resistance and high cardiac index leading to hypotension and warm extremities (ie, "warm sepsis"). Vasopressors with prominent alpha vasoconstrictor effects (eg, norepinephrine and phenylephrine) are probably the most effective in this setting, since the predominant physiological abnormality is low systemic vascular resistance. Phenylephrine may be useful when tachycardia or dysrhythmias preclude the use of agents with beta-adrenergic activity.
Hypodynamic septic shock is characterized by a low to modestly reduced systemic vascular resistance and low cardiac index leading to hypotension and decreased skin perfusion (ie, "cold sepsis"). Norepinephrine is a reasonable first choice in such patients because its effects on beta-1 adrenergic receptors will increase the cardiac index and its effects on alpha-1 adrenergic receptors will cause vasoconstriction. For patients with persistent hypotension and a low cardiac output, an inotropic agent is often added. We typically add epinephrine in this situation, although dobutamine is an alternative. (See 'Epinephrine' above and 'Dobutamine' above.)
Vasopressin or terlipressin may be beneficial, when added to other vasopressor agents, such as norepinephrine [16]. For patients who remain hypotensive despite two vasopressors, there is no evidence that adding a third vasopressor is superior to trying an alternative combination of vasopressors (ie, switching from norepinephrine plus vasopressin to norepinephrine plus phenylephrine).

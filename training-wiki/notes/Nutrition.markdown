## Nutritional screening

- Nutritional Risk Screening Score[@Kondrup:2003wa]
	- 2 dimensions
		- severity of illness
			- 3 point for being in ICU!
		- nutritional status: low BMI or recent significant weight loss
	- then add 1 point for being > 70 yrs
	- start feeding if >= 3

## Evidence for early nutrition in critical illness

- immediate (within 24 hours) feed above anastamosis in GI surgery
	- safe
	- less complications

- burns
	- European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) guidelines
		- deliver nutrition within 3 days
		- probably no benefit to very early (<24h)
- 60% if untreated ICU patients have gastro-oesophageal reflux (because of the effect of sedatives on the lower oesophageal sphincter?)
	- reflux is common with straining, coughing (i.e. on tracheal suctioning)
	- hence importance of head-up positioning

- title: Early versus traditional postoperative feeding in patients undergoing resectional gastrointestinal surgery: a meta-analysis
- notes:
	- safe to feed above anastamosis in GI surgery
	- systematic review, 15 RCTs, 1240 patients
	- alsoe true in upper GI surgery (Lassen 2008, PMID 18438106)

- title: Effect of Evidence-Based Feeding Guidelines on Mortality of Critically Ill AdultsA Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial
- notes:
	- ANZICS study
	- implementation of nutrition guideline 2003--4 in cluster RCT
	- feed delivered earlier in intervention hospitals (EN and TPN), and consequently greater calories in the first 10 days
	- no difference in outcomes

- notes:
	- delayed gastric emptying might be the result of hypersensitivity of the small intestine to nutrients (and to an extent this is seen in the EDEN trial)
	- in other words, there is a normal reflex to reduce gastric emptying if the intestine is loaded and this is exaggerated in the critically ill

- notes:
	- RCT, 2328 patients
	- compared European vs US guidelines: early vs deferred TPN (3 vs 8 days)
		- early initation group on 20% dex, day 1 target = 400kcal, day 2 800 kcal, day 3 - start TPN
		- late initiation group received 5% dextrose in equivalent volume to TPN in early initiation group
	- simultaneously in each group enteral nutrition was attempted and parenteral route discontinued when >80% of caloric requirement achieved
	- late initiation led to shorter IPPV, RRT and greater critical care survival rates, less infection, and cheaper
	- van den Berghe paper therefore predominantly surgical (80%+) patients

- notes:
	- EDEN trial
	- 1000 ALI patients
	- intervention: trophic feeding (10--20mls/hr) vs full feeding for 1st 6 days
	- prohibited concomitant TPN (so was a comparison of EN rate only)
	- no difference in outcomes

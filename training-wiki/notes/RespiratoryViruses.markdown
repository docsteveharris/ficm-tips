Title: RespiratoryViruses
Tags:

- nasopharyngeal swabs are +ve for respiratory viruses in 20--30% health adults
- respiratory viruses are detected in around 1/3 of patients with CAP
- Influenza viruses A or B, parainfluenza viruses 1-3, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus
- mixed bacterial-viral infections account for around 20% severe CAP


## Influenza

- can cause pneumonia, more commonly URTI and predispose to 2ndry bacterial pneumonia
- primary influenza pneumonia in 'high risk' significant only in high risk

High risk for influenza complications |
------------------------------------- |
Children < 2 |
Adults > 65 |
Chronic disease |
Immunosuppression |
Pregnancy or <2/52 postpartum |
Children < 19 on long term aspirin |
BMI > 40 |
Nursing home residents |

- secondary bacterial pneumonia of which approximately 50% is strep pneumoniae, 20% is staph, and H influenzae also common

### Diagnosis

- viral shedding peaks at 24--48 hours and should be undetectable by 5--10 days in immunocompetent; timing of test therefore affects sensitivity
- rapid antigen (qualitative) tests: sensitivity 50--60%
- real time PCR
- optimal specimen is a nasopharyngeal swab/aspirate/washing (swab to posterior nasopharynx via nose, rotate for 15 seconds)
- repeat samples from upper and lower respiratory tract, and consecutive days may improve diagnosis

### Treatment

- 2 classes
	- neuraminidase inhibitors (zanamivir (Relenza), ostelamavir (Tamiflu)): Influenza A & B: Inhibiting neuraminidase- which, as with haemagglutin, is specific to influenza- blocks the exit of the influenza virus from the host cell, thereby preventing replication in other than a few host cells.
	- adamantanses (amantadine, rimantadine): Influenza A only
- Evidence for benefit
	- started < 24--30 hrs of fever, shortens duration of symptoms by 1--3 days
	- started > 48 hours, little benefit
	- some evidence for mortality reducton in the most unwell
- Zanamivir - inhaled only, contraindicated in asthma, IV preparation in trials, not recommended for the ventilated patients since the lactose carrier can clog ventilator tubing
- Ostelamavir - oral, good bioavailability


## Parainfluenza

- PIV infections occurred in 7% of 3500 HSCT patients in a single centre report (90% UTRI only at presentation), steroids associated with progression from upper to lower respiratory tract disease
- parainfluenza 1--3 but only 3 associated with severe lower respiratory tract disease otherwise mild URTI in immunocompetent
- 90% of adults are exposed but re-infection common and previous infection incompletely protective
- no antivirals with proven efficacy
- small series have reported use of ribavirin in immunocompromised patients but without evidence for benefit
- intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been tried
- 20% mortality among HSCT patients with LRTI 2ndry to PIV
- diagnosis: nasal washings best, store in fridge since virus not viable at room temperature for > 1hr

## Respiratory syncitial virus

- traditionally disease of children but important in immunocompromised too
- reinfection common and important but generally not as severe, increasingly commong in the elderly
- causes direct apnoea in infants: ?SIDS related ?mechanism

- NEJM study evaluated RSV in elderly and high risk
	- annual incidence 2x that of influenza
	- similar morbidity and mortality to Influenza A
	- immune response part of pathology
- infiltrates bronchial epithelium
- commonly associated with SIADH esp in severe (IPPV)
- diagnosis: nasal wash, BAL
- rapid antigen assays >90% sensitive but PCR also now ccommon
- Rx: ribavirin in immunocompromised adults (CI in pregnancy)

## Adenovirus

- febrile illness in young children (URTI)
- 10% of childhood pneumonia
- high incidence of pulmonary sequelae (bronchiectasis)
- conjunctivits may be seen in epidemics among young adults in crowded conditions
- re-activation of endogenous virus possible in the immunocompromised
- no Rx?

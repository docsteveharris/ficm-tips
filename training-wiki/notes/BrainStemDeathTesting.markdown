## Notes
Contraindications to organ donation
- HIV, nvCJD
- Malignancy except primary brain tumours
- Patient refusal

Preconditions
1. Apneoic patient on ventilator
2. Structural cause of brain injury (trauma or haemorrhage)
3. Reversible causes excluded: endocrine, metabolic and drugs (Na<160, T>34

Testing
- Who? Not part of transplant team, 1 consultant and one doctor >5yr registered
- When? >6hrs after coma onset or 24hrs post ROSC if cardiac arrest causal
- Two tests needed but time inbetween not specified

How?
1. CN2 & 3: Pupillary reflexes
2. CNVa and VII: No corneal reflex
3. CNVII: No  motor response in cranial nerve region (i.e. facial) to peripheral or central pain; Spinal reflex movements allowed
4. CNIII,IV, & VI & CNVIII: Oculo-vestibular: 50ml ice cold water, observe for 1 minute after
5. CNIX & X: Suction catheter to pharynx and trachea
6. Respiratory Centres: 5min 100% preox; 10min apnoea to PaCO2>6.7; Maintain O2 via suction catheter in ETT with >250ml/min O2 (new guidelines will say pH<7.35 too)

Time of death is documented as first test

## Log

- DCD (donation after cardiac death) Non-Heart Beating Donor Guidance (kidneys, lungs, livers, corneas); 
    - warm ischaemia time is problematic: types of donor 'awaiting cardiac arrest' commonest (ie icu patients where treatment is being withdrawn but who don't make brainstem death criteria); 
    - 5mins after arrest confirm death - if death is not rapid then organ donation wil not be possible

- title: Effects of reducing beta-lactam antibiotic pressure on intestinal colonization of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria
- notes: 
	- 75% of antibiotic resistance is acquired endogenously
	- antibiotic cycling (on a weekly basis) does not reduce resistance pressures
	- fluoroquinolone resistance is acquired rapidly

# colistin

●Colistin, or polymyxin E, is a bactericidal drug that disrupts the outer cell membrane of gram-negative rods and is primarily used for infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. (See 'Introduction' above and 'Mechanism of action' above.)
●Acquired resistance to colistin is uncommon. However, certain gram-negative rods are intrinsically resistant. These include Burkholderia cepacia, Serratia marcescens, Moraxella catarrhalis, Proteus spp, Providencia spp, and Morganella morganii. Penetration of colistin into the cerebrospinal fluid is low when administered intravenously. (See 'Pharmacokinetics' above.)
●Colistin is formulated as colistimethate sodium for reconstitution for parenteral use. It is measured as grams of colistin base activity in the United States and as international units of colistimethate sodium in Europe. The recommended dosage varies by formulation and manufacturer. Dose adjustments should be made in the setting of renal dysfunction. (See 'Systemic administration' above.)
●Inhaled colistin should be used with caution and must be mixed IMMEDIATELY PRIOR to administration. (See 'Inhaled administration' above.)
●The incidence of renal toxicity ranges from 8 to 58 percent, and renal impairment appears to be reversible. Neurologic toxicity, mainly paresthesias, is also associated with colistin. (See 'Adverse reactions' above.)

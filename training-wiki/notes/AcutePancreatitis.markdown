## Nutrition

- early enteral feeding is recommended
	- maintain gut barrier, minimise bacterial translocation
	- avoid the complications of TPN
	- 2010 metanalysis demonstrated reduced mortality, infections and need for surgery
- nasojejunal tube feeding is preferred: need to place the tube beyond the ligament of Treitz 
- nasogastric feeding may be safe but not clear
- semi-elemental feed should be considered if assume decreased production of pancreatic enzymes (note that the elemental feeds can produce diarrhoea)
- fluid collections (cysts) are not a contra-indication but in some patients feeding may make pain or inflammation worse; if so, switch to TPN
- do not provide TPN before 5 days (increased complications)

- title: Enteral versus parenteral nutrition for acute pancreatitis
- notes:
	- Cochrane systematic review
	- 348 patients in 8 RCTs
	- RR for mortality using EN was 0.5 (95%CI 0.28--0.91)
	- similar (greater) in the subgroup with severe acute pancreatitis

- title: Nutrition support in acute pancreatitis: a systematic review of the literature
- notes: 
	- similar conclusions to Cochrane review for question of EN vs PN
	- unable to find evidence comparing EN vs IV maintenance only
	- very early PN probably harmful (i.e. wait a minimum of 5 days)

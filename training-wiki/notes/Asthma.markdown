There are some widely recognised principles for the use of mechanical ventilation in asthma based on the problems arising from dynamic hyperinflation of the lungs. These are reviewed here because some of the principles are counter-intuitive (favouring a higher respiratory rate for a given minute volume) and context dependent (the application of external Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP)).

- the blood PaCO~2~ and therefore the pH depends on the metabolic rate and the alveolar ventilation. The metabolic rate is increased in severe asthma because of the increased work of breathing which arises from increased airways resistance, the mechanical disadvantage of the thorax when hyper-inflated, and patient anxiety. Sedation, and paralysis, and mechanical ventilation remove some of the metabolic demand. During invasive positive pressure ventilation (PPV), a degree of hypercarbia is tolerated.

- alveolar emptying is a passive process and the optimum physical conditions for this for a given level of alveolar ventilation are maximised by (Tuxen, 1987)

	- increasing the respiratory rate rather than the tidal volume
	- prolonging the expiratory phase which can either be achieved by decreasing the respiratory rate, or prolonging the inspiratory:expiratory (I:E) ratio.
	- minimise PEEP during mandatory PPV (Oddo, 2006) which will in turn maximise the pressure gradient driving expiratory flow. When using a spontaneous mode, external PEEP should be set at around 80% of the measured intrinsic value otherwise abnormally negative intra-pleural pressures must be generated by the patient in order to trigger a breath. This means that PEEP might be used initially during non-invasive ventilation prior to invasive PPV, then removed immediately after intubation, and started again during weaning.

	Because flow decreased exponentially, then extending the I:E ratio beyond 1:4 is unlikely to be helpful.(Leatherman, 2004)  The respiratory rate set is normally a compromise between these two aims, without immediately trying to correct hypercapnoea.

- maintain a high index of suspicion for pneumothoraces
- minimise the external dead space of the breathing circuit, and in particular using a heated water humidifier rather than a Heat & Moisture Exchanger (HME)

The particular issue in this case was the re-appearance of bronchospasm whenever the sedation was lightened leading to a prolonged period of deep sedation and use of neuromuscular blockers with high dose steroids. These are all risk factors for critical illness myopathy, but glucocorticoid exposure is probably the most important factor. This creates an imperative to minimise the duration of mechanical ventilation once instituted. In a patient with a history of street drugs, this is likely to be difficult as the sedation requirements   will be great.

# Lessons learnt

- respiratory rate setting is a compromise between maximising the expiratory time, and achieving a minute volume with the smallest possible tidal volumes
- extrinsic PEEP (i.e. that which is set on the mechanical ventilator) may be helpful in spontaneous modes of ventilation as it reduces the pressure difference that the patient must generate for the trigger to activate. It is of no use in a mandatory mode. Extrinsic PEEP should not exceed 80% of the measured intrinsic PEEP else hyperinflation will ensue.
- hyperinflation and increased intra-thoracic pressure will impede right ventricular return and lead to cardiovascular collapse. This should be managed with fluid resuscitation and, in extremis, by temporarily breaking the breathing circuit, and forceful external compression of the chest.
- a high index of suspicion must be maintained for pneumothorax which can mimic the presentation of worsening airway obstruction and hyperinflation

## Practical tips


- Minimise lung distension by these principles (think in terms of the end expiratory volume)
	- for a given minute volume
		- smaller tidal volumes and higher respiratory rates
	- for a given tidal volume, maximise the expiratory time
- I:E > 4 is unlikely to be helpful because the low flows at end expiration contribute very little to alveolar emptying [@Leatherman:CritCareMed:2004]
- permissive hypercapnoea is acceptable
- volume control easier to manage initially than pressure control, but set a decelerating flow pattern if possible to avoid very high peak pressures which *may* may be transiently transmitted to the most compliant alveoli (even if P_plateau_ is overall much lower)
- initial IPPV settings
    - Mode: Pressure-controlled ventilation
    - Respiratory rate: 10–15 breaths/min
    - Tidal volum e: 6–10 ml/kg
    - Minute ventilat ion: 8–10 L/min
    - PEEP: 80% intrinsic peep - measure by applying exp hold and watching pressure; only relevant if spontaneous ventilating which is unlikely in IPPV but might be an issue if using NIV
    - I:E ratio: 1:3
    - Inspiratory flow: 100 L/min
    - FIO2:Maintain SaO2 >90%
    - Pplat: <35 cm H2O
    - VEI: <1.4 L
    -  Allow Ppeak to 50cm

## 130825 notes

- Dynamic hyperinflation creates intrinsic PEEP and elevates the plateau pressure (Pplat), which can lead to cardiovascular collapse and barotrauma, as well as increase the work of breathing. Adjustments of the ventilator settings should try to minimize the risk of these events, preferably maintaining an inspiratory Pplat less than 30 cm H2O and an intrinsic PEEP less than 10 to 15 cm H2O. The following adjustments may help achieve these goals by decreasing air trapping [7]:
- PEEP and asthma: predominant location of airway resistance is rigid, non-collapsible central airways and for this reason applied external PEEP is transmitted to the alveoli and thereby reduces the pressure gradient favouring expiration, and increases lung volumes [@McFadden:J Appl Physiol:1977]
- Permissive hypercapnoea recommended
- Minimise deadspace; use a humidifier instead of an HME which will also minimise hypercapnoea
- Humdify the circuit

- Experimental therapies to consider
    - Heliox: converts turbulent flow to laminar flow (and therefore resistance to flow is proportional from *v* instead of  *v^2^*
    - use of volative anaesthetics

  notes:


See below for nice example of how end expiratory lung volume (and therefore alveolar distension) depends on ventilator settings. From Tuxen and Lane
    - for a given minute volume (V_E_) then maximise respiratory rate (and therefore minimise tidal volume)
    - for a given tidal volume, maximise expiratory time

## Rough notes

- Oedematous airways close during expiration at a much large lung volume than normal; the same tidal volume is added in the next breath and the lung shifts progressively to a steeper and steeper part of the Pressure-Volume Compliance Curve; Expiration becomes active and prolonged in an attempt to empty these overinflated, obstructed airways - and this decr venous return - hence Pulsus Paradox us (exaggerated Spont Vent version of SPV)
- Expiratory flows more affected than inspiratory flows because intrapleural pressure is positive and "squashes" G17+ airways (ie non-cartalaginous)
- Active expiration and raised alveolar pressures incr West Zone 1
- Cardiac arrest in asthma from inadequate venous return

### Practical
- IPPV: Inspect Flow-Time Loops: Expiration wil be slow - ensure that I:E is great enough that flow is zero (ie expiration complete before next IPPV inspiration) else IPPV wil contribute its own hyperinflatory effect
Therapeutic PEEP: Oedematous airways wil close early (ie Closing Capacity is increased)
- therefore apply PEEP cautiously; if expiratory Tidal Volume on the next few breathes increases with PEEP then it may be of some benefit; Beware though that the extrinsic PEEP does not add to the venous return problems
Volume Control ventilation: Accept v high Peak Inspiratory Pressures - these wil be due to Airway resistance and not actualy transmitted to the alveoli: ie Calculate necessary MV (7ml/kg x 10/breaths/min = ~5000ml for a 70kg adult; Maximise I:E
- Induction Agent s
	- Midazolam: 1 mg (intravenous) slowly, every 2–3 min until the patient alows positioning and airways inspection
	Beware: Hypotension, respiratory depression
	- Ketamine: 1–2 mg/kg (intravenous) at a rate of 0.5 mg/kg/min
	Beware: Sympaticomimetic effects, delirium
- Propofol: 60–80 mg/min initial intravenous infusion up to 2.0 mg/kg, folowed by an infusion of 5–10 mg/kg/hour as needed Beware: Respiratory depression
- Ventilation Tips
- Avoid dynamic hyperinflation by long exp phase, eliminate insp pause, slow RR, permissive hypercapnia
- Permissive Hypercapnia tolerated wel if PaCO2 12 and steady
- Noshunt in pure asthma (ventilation is poor but perfusion is good) therefore normally easy to correct hypoxia with incr FiO2; BUT if this fails then must suspect mucus plugg ing, pneum ot horax, pneumonia

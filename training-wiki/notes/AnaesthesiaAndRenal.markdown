Metadata: 

- Creatinine $\alpha$ 1/GFR: i.e. rectangular hyperbola: need to halve GFR before creatinine will rise plot 1/creatinine vs time can estimate ESRF
- GFR falls by 1% per annum after 30yrs (i.e 80yrs at best 50% GFR)
- GFR<35ml/min: definition for diagnosis of 'Renal Failure'
- GFR<15ml/min: dialysis required
- GFR<5ml/min: "End Stage Renal Failure"

## Pharmacokinetics
- Hypoalbuminaemia: hence increased availability of protein bound drugs
- Acidosis: hence incr availability of thiopentone (weak acid, pKa 7.6), propofol pKa 6-8.6??
- Reduce doses of induction agents by 30%
- Plasma cholinesterase activity normal
- Neostigmine/Glyco: prolonged excretion
- Local anaesthetics: reduced duration, reduced Vd (therefore max safe dose 75% normal)

## Associated Pathology
Underlying Cause: DM, HTN, Autoimmune, Chronic pyelonephritis
10% CRF have Aortic Stenosis (ectopic Ca deposition) - endocarditis more common
IHD common (2ndry HTN, hyperlipidaemia 2ndry decr lipoprotein lipase activity)

# Pre-op
- Anuric, oliguric, or polyuric? How much fluid can they handle
- Current Fluid Status: (Best to wait 6hrs post dialysis b/c to allow fluid shifts to 'settle', and for heparin to pass)
- Normal Hb 8-10g/l: Avoid transfusing above this as poorly tolerated (pulmonary oedema etc ppt if Hb>10)
- K+>6: Will need preoperative dialysis b/c will have to wait 2-3d after for next spin
- Uraemia and Bleeding Tendency: Not corrected by platelet transfusion: DDAVP best 
- Coagulopathy related to impaired vWF release; Rx DDAVP 0.3mcg/kg effective within 1-2hrs but duration  only 6-8hrs; Intravenous oestogens similar effect but longer duration of action
- Intra-op
- Fistula Arm: Wrap and pad very carefully; avoid veins on anterior/volar aspect of forearms
- Delayed gastric emptying / autonomic neuropathy common
- Avoid suxamethonium (expect +0.5mmol K)
- Treat as immunosuppressed so maximum precautions for all invasive procedures

## Chronic Renal Failure
- 5yr survival overall <50%
- H+/K+ exchange across ECF/ICF so in acute acidosis 0.5mmol K increase for each 0.1 unit fall in pH
- Hypertriglyceridaemia 2nd reduced lipoprotein lipase activity
- Aortic Stenosis/Sclerosis fr ectopic Calcium deposition; hence endocarditis more common

## Patients on Dialysis

- Peritoneal: Drain abdominal fluid before procedure else compromises FRC etc; Dialysis can be missed for 2-3d but if longer delay (ie. Abdominal surgery) will need temporary CVVD
- Fistulas & Lines: Protect at all costs
- Delay dialysis 1-2d post-surgery because of heparin anticoagulation
- Post-transplant: Rx as immunosuppressed (ie steroid supplements, scrupulous line technique etc); the transplant at best will have 50% of normal nephron number
- Beware proning tranplant patients as kidney is very superficial and easily compressed
- Dialysis & Surgery (heparin & fluid issues)
	- Surgery 6hrs post-dialysis
	- No dialysis ~2d after b/c heparin

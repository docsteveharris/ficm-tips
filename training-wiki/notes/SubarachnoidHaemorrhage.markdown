The grading system of the World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) (table 3) was proposed in 1988 [16]. It is based on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (see 'Glasgow Coma Scale' above) and the presence of motor deficits.

Grade 1: GCS score 15, no motor deficit
Grade 2: GCS score 13 to 14, no motor deficit
Grade 3: GCS score 13 to 14, with motor deficit
Grade 4: GCS score 7 to 12, with or without motor deficit
Grade 5: GCS score 3 to 6, with or without motor deficit

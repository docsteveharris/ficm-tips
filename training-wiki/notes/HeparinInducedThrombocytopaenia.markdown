- notes:
	- The negative predictive value of a low probability 4Ts score was 0.998.
	- The probability of HIT is low
		- low (1--3 points): 55% patients, NPV 0.998
		- medium (4--5 points): 36% patients, PPV 14%
		- high (6--8 points): 8% patients, PPV 64%

4TS category | 2 pts | 1pt | 0 pts
-------------|-------|-----|------
**Thrombocytopaenia** | >50% fall, nadir >20 | 30--50% fall, nadir 10--19 | <30% fall, nadir <10
**Timing** | 5--10d after start, <1d if prev exposure | not clear | <= 4 days w/o prev exp
**Thrombosis/other sequelae** | New thrombosis, skin necrosis | Suspected or progressive thrombosis, skin lesions | None
**Other causes** | None apparent | Possible | Definite

- To examine the accuracy of the 4Ts score in predicting HIT, academic investigators performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 trials comprising 3068 patients with suspected HIT evaluated by the 4Ts scoring system and a reference standard.

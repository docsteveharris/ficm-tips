Introduced in 1955 in the US
Recognised to cause fatal overdose in 1966




## Toxic levels

### Acute toxicity
- see nomogram for Rx
- note that US has adjusted down Rx threshold by 25% (not UK)
* Toxicity is unlikely to result from a single dose of less than 150 mg/kg in a child or 7.5 to 10 g for an adult [17].
* Toxicity is likely to occur with single ingestions greater than 250 mg/kg or those greater than 12 g over a 24-hour period [18,19].
* Virtually all patients who ingest doses in excess of 350 mg/kg develop severe liver toxicity (defined as peak aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels greater than 1000 IU/L) unless appropriately treated [18].
- above 25mcg/ml (165 micromol/l) considered as probable toxicity (esp if timing unclear (see below))

### Chronic toxicity
* Therapeutic serum concentrations range from 10 to 20 mcg/mL (65 to 130 micromol/L).
* Liver dysfunction and levels greater than therapeutic range should be treated as overdose


## Clinical Factors affecting toxicity

- acute alcohol protective? b/c competetes for CYP2E1 (whereas chronic is harmful)
- chronic alcohol and single OD ?no difference
- chronic alchohol and staggered OD - much greater risk

- other meds that incr CYP2E1:  (eg, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin) and antituberculosis drugs (eg, isoniazid and rifampin)
- meds that compete for the glucuronidation pathway: septrin, zidovudine

- malnutrition assoc with decr hepatic glucose reserves needed for glucuronidation and depleted glutathione stores


## Clinical stages of overdose

### Stage 1 (Day 1)
Nausea, vomiting but biochemically normal
Measure levels at 4-24 hours (before 4 hours will miss peak)

### Stage 2 (Day 2-3)
Abnormal laboratory values start to manifest
But if normal LFTs at 36 hours then liver injury/toxicity is v unlikely

### Stage 3 (Day 4)
Liver dysfunction peaks
Renal dysfunction in approx 50% of ALF

### Stage 4 (Day 4 to 14)

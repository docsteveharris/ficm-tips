# Q: What is the best dose of [[RenalReplacementTherapy|RRT]]?
- anticipate that around 85% of the prescribed dose is delivered
- trend to improved survival in sepsis only except in ATN trial where the opposite was observed
- trend to increased ESRF with higher doses of CVVH

- title: I.D.E.A.L.-I.C.U. (Initiation of Dialysis EArly Versus Late in Intensive Care Unit)  
- ref: http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01682590
- notes:
	- French RCT
	- 824 patients with septic shock
	- 0--12 vs 48--60 hrs comparison

- title: Effects of different doses in continuous veno-venous haemofiltration on outcomes of acute renal failure: a prospective randomised trial.
- notes:
	- RCT, 425 patients in ICU with ARF, 15 day survival
		- sepsis in ~15%
	- 3 doses 20,35, and 45 mls/kg/hr
		- dose based on actual body weight (from existing health records)
		- CVVH (no dialysis)
		- lactate based fluid
	- 20 mls/kg/hr had worst survival
	- 45 mls/kg/hr had worst recovert of renal function (90% vs 95%)

- title: Intensity of continuous renal-replacement therapy in critically ill patients.
- notes:
	- RCT, 1508 patients in ICU with standard indication for RRT (oliguria, acidosis, hyperkalaemia, creat > 300, oedema etc)
		- severe sepsis in 50%
	- CVVHDF with dialysate to filtrate ratio of 1:1 and all post-filter
	- 25 vs 40 mls/kg/hr doses targeted and 22 and 33 achieved
		- actual body weight at time of randomisation
		- bicarbonate based fluid
	- no difference in survival among all comes (45% mortality at 90 days)
	- similar trend to increase ESRF among those on higher dose (6.8% vs 4.4%)
	- trend to reduced mortality in patients with sepsis (46.8 vs 51.2%)
	- late start: 6 days in ICU at enrollment

- title: High-volume haemofiltration for sepsis
- notes:
	- cochrane systematic review
	- patients with
	- high versus low volume haemofiltration
	- 3 RCTs identified with 19, 11 and 33 participants respectively
	- non-significant trend to reduced mortality

- title: High-dose renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
- notes:
	- wider inclusion criteria than the paper by Borthwick
	- all AKI (with and without sepsis)
	- mortality relative risk 0.77--1.03
	- ESRF relative risk 0.92-1.44

- title: Effects of early high-volume continuous venovenous hemofiltration on survival and recovery of renal function in intensive care patients with acute renal failure: A prospective, randomized trial
- notes:
	- post-operative (50% cardiac) ventilated patients with oliguria and CrCl < 30ml/min
	- dose varied from 20 to 48 mls/kg/hr
	- early grp started  within 7 hours, late grp within 42 hrs
	- no difference in outcomes

- title: Comparison of pump-driven and spontaneous continuous haemofiltration in postoperative acute renal failure.
- notes:
	- CAVH (arterial) vs CVVH (pump driven)
	- better survival with higher doses over range 7--15 l/day which is equivalent to 4--8 mls/kg/hr

- ref: [@Network:2008gr](papers2://publication/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa0802639)
- title: Intensity of Renal Support in Critically Ill Patients with Acute Kidney Injury
- notes:
	- RCT, 1124 patients with MOF or sepsis
	- high dose = IHD if stable else SLED 6x/week or CVVHDF at 35 mls/kg/hr
	- low dose = IHD if stable else SLED 3x/week or CVVHDF at 20 mls/kg/hr
	- stable meant SOFA CVS 0--2 and unstable meant SOFA CVS 3--4
	- 50% septic
	- actual body weight used (before illness)
	- outcomes similar
		- but low dose better for sepsis this time
		- possible trend to incr ESRF among the high dose again
	- late randomisation again (1 week in ICU)
